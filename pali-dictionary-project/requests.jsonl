Do **not** return single-word outputs (e.g., \"<b>Anussarati</b>\").\n   - A valid **sutta reference number** (also known as the **sutta number**) must be **explicitly present within the selected sentence**.\n   - **STRICT RULE**: \n      - If the **sutta reference number** (e.g., \"AN 3.71\") is **not found directly in the selected sentence itself**, **discard the selected sentence**.\n   - Remove any **sutta reference number** from the selected sentence (e.g., \"AN 3.71\", \"AN 3.71 (simpl)\", or similar citation formats) once identified.\n   - Store the **sutta reference number** in the `\"class_source\"` field.\n   - **Handling `(simpl)` in `class_source` Formatting:**\n      - If the extracted **sutta reference number** contains **\"(simpl)\"**, preserve it (e.g., `\"DN 19.7 (simpl)\"`).\n      - If **\"(simpl)\"** is **not present**, return only the core sutta number (e.g., `\"DN 19.7\"`).\n\n2. **Ensure Correct Sutta Reference Name Retrieval:**\n   - The **sutta reference name** (also known as the **sutta reference name**) will not be available in the exercise dataset.\n   - After obtaining the **sutta reference number**, retrieve the corresponding **sutta reference name**.\n      - Example: If **sutta reference number** is `\"AN 2.1\"`, the **sutta reference name** should be `\"vajjasutta\u1e43\"`.\n      - If the correct **sutta reference name** cannot be determined, return `\"unknown\"` instead of making an incorrect guess.\n   - Store the **sutta reference name** in the `\"class_sutta\"` field.\n\n3. **Formatting Rule for `\"class_example\"`:**\n   - The **selected Pali word** is **highlighted alone** within `<b>...</b>`.\n   - The capitalization of the entire sentence must remain exactly as in the exercise dataset.\n\n4. **`\"pali\"` Field Rule:**  \n   - The `\"pali\"` field **must always** match the **exact given Pali word**, including numbering if present (e.g., `\"anussarati 1.1\"`).\n   - Even if the extracted sentence contains a different **morphological form**, the `\"pali\"` field must **not** be altered.\n\n5. **`\"explanation\"` Field Rule:**  \n   - The `\"explanation\"` field should provide a brief justification for why the response was generated **if the user asks a question**.\n   - If the user requests a solution, provide a practical suggestion to achieve the desired outcome.\n   - If **no question is provided**, return an **empty string** (`\"\"`).\n\n6. **Output Structure and Formatting:**\n   - If a valid sentence is found and the sutta reference number is explicitly present within it, return the output in **JSON format** with the following structure:\n      {\n         \"id\": \"<Given Pali ID>\",\n         \"pali\": \"<Given Pali word>\",\n         \"selected_pali_word\": \"<Selected Pali word>\",\n         \"class_source\": \"<Sutta Reference Number>\",\n         \"class_sutta\": \"<Sutta Reference Name>\",\n         \"class_example\": \"<A full sentence with <b>Selected Pali word</b> highlighted, preserving original capitalization>\",\n         \"english_translation\": \"<English translation>\",\n         \"explanation\": \"<A justification for why this response was generated and a solution if applicable, or an empty string if no question was asked>\"\n      }\n   - If the sutta reference number is missing from the selected sentence, return an **empty JSON object** `{}`.\n   - If no valid sentence is found, return an **empty JSON object** `{}`.\n\n7. **Strict JSON Output rules:**\n   **IMPORTANT: FOLLOW THESE RULES STRICTLY**\n   - **DO NOT** wrap the JSON output in Markdown formatting (e.g., ` ```json ... ``` `).\n   - **DO NOT** add any extra text before or after the JSON response.\n   - **DO NOT** format the output as a code block.\n   - **ONLY RETURN A PLAIN JSON OBJECT.**\n   - **Failure to follow these rules will result in an invalid response.**\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "\n    For the given Pali word: \"anuttara\" with ID: \"4524\",     extract a relevant sentence in exercise data: \"Class 2 Exercises\n\nnamo tassa bhagavato arahato samm\u0101-sambuddhassa\t \t\t\t\t\t\nHomage to him, the Blessed One, the Worthy One, the fully Enlightened One.\n\u2003\navijj\u0101ya tv'eva asesa-vir\u0101ga-nirodh\u0101 sa\u1e45kh\u0101ra-nirodho, sa\u1e45kh\u0101ra-nirodh\u0101 vi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101\u1e47a-nirodho, vi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101\u1e47a-nirodh\u0101 n\u0101mar\u016bpa-nirodho, n\u0101mar\u016bpa-nirodh\u0101 sa\u1e37\u0101yatana-nirodho, sa\u1e37\u0101yatana-nirodh\u0101 phassa-nirodho, phassa-nirodh\u0101 vedan\u0101-nirodho, vedan\u0101-nirodh\u0101 ta\u1e47h\u0101-nirodho, ta\u1e47h\u0101-nirodh\u0101 up\u0101d\u0101na-nirodho, up\u0101d\u0101na-nirodh\u0101 bhava-nirodho, bhava-nirodh\u0101 j\u0101ti-nirodho, j\u0101ti-nirodh\u0101 jar\u0101-mara\u1e47a\u1e43 soka-parideva-dukkha-domanass'up\u0101y\u0101s\u0101 nirujjhanti. \nBut from the complete fading away and cessation of ignorance there is cessation of volitional formations;

Do **not** return single-word outputs (e.g., \"<b>Anussarati</b>\").\n   - A valid **sutta reference number** (also known as the **sutta number**) must be **explicitly present within the selected sentence**.\n   - **STRICT RULE**: \n      - If the **sutta reference number** (e.g., \"AN 3.71\") is **not found directly in the selected sentence itself**, **discard the selected sentence**.\n   - Remove any **sutta reference number** from the selected sentence (e.g., \"AN 3.71\", \"AN 3.71 (simpl)\", or similar citation formats) once identified.\n   - Store the **sutta reference number** in the `\"class_source\"` field.\n   - **Handling `(simpl)` in `class_source` Formatting:**\n      - If the extracted **sutta reference number** contains **\"(simpl)\"**, preserve it (e.g., `\"DN 19.7 (simpl)\"`).\n      - If **\"(simpl)\"** is **not present**, return only the core sutta number (e.g., `\"DN 19.7\"`).\n\n2. **Ensure Correct Sutta Reference Name Retrieval:**\n   - The **sutta reference name** (also known as the **sutta reference name**) will not be available in the exercise dataset.\n   - After obtaining the **sutta reference number**, retrieve the corresponding **sutta reference name**.\n      - Example: If **sutta reference number** is `\"AN 2.1\"`, the **sutta reference name** should be `\"vajjasutta\u1e43\"`.\n      - If the correct **sutta reference name** cannot be determined, return `\"unknown\"` instead of making an incorrect guess.\n   - Store the **sutta reference name** in the `\"class_sutta\"` field.\n\n3. **Formatting Rule for `\"class_example\"`:**\n   - The **selected Pali word** is **highlighted alone** within `<b>...</b>`.\n   - The capitalization of the entire sentence must remain exactly as in the exercise dataset.\n\n4. **`\"pali\"` Field Rule:**  \n   - The `\"pali\"` field **must always** match the **exact given Pali word**, including numbering if present (e.g., `\"anussarati 1.1\"`).\n   - Even if the extracted sentence contains a different **morphological form**, the `\"pali\"` field must **not** be altered.\n\n5. **`\"explanation\"` Field Rule:**  \n   - The `\"explanation\"` field should provide a brief justification for why the response was generated **if the user asks a question**.\n   - If the user requests a solution, provide a practical suggestion to achieve the desired outcome.\n   - If **no question is provided**, return an **empty string** (`\"\"`).\n\n6. **Output Structure and Formatting:**\n   - If a valid sentence is found and the sutta reference number is explicitly present within it, return the output in **JSON format** with the following structure:\n      {\n         \"id\": \"<Given Pali ID>\",\n         \"pali\": \"<Given Pali word>\",\n         \"selected_pali_word\": \"<Selected Pali word>\",\n         \"class_source\": \"<Sutta Reference Number>\",\n         \"class_sutta\": \"<Sutta Reference Name>\",\n         \"class_example\": \"<A full sentence with <b>Selected Pali word</b> highlighted, preserving original capitalization>\",\n         \"english_translation\": \"<English translation>\",\n         \"explanation\": \"<A justification for why this response was generated and a solution if applicable, or an empty string if no question was asked>\"\n      }\n   - If the sutta reference number is missing from the selected sentence, return an **empty JSON object** `{}`.\n   - If no valid sentence is found, return an **empty JSON object** `{}`.\n\n7. **Strict JSON Output rules:**\n   **IMPORTANT: FOLLOW THESE RULES STRICTLY**\n   - **DO NOT** wrap the JSON output in Markdown formatting (e.g., ` ```json ... ``` `).\n   - **DO NOT** add any extra text before or after the JSON response.\n   - **DO NOT** format the output as a code block.\n   - **ONLY RETURN A PLAIN JSON OBJECT.**\n   - **Failure to follow these rules will result in an invalid response.**\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "\n    For the given Pali word: \"araha\u1e43\" with ID: \"8943\",     extract a relevant sentence in exercise data: \"Class 2 Exercises\n\nnamo tassa bhagavato arahato samm\u0101-sambuddhassa\t \t\t\t\t\t\nHomage to him, the Blessed One, the Worthy One, the fully Enlightened One.\n\u2003\navijj\u0101ya tv'eva asesa-vir\u0101ga-nirodh\u0101 sa\u1e45kh\u0101ra-nirodho, sa\u1e45kh\u0101ra-nirodh\u0101 vi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101\u1e47a-nirodho, vi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101\u1e47a-nirodh\u0101 n\u0101mar\u016bpa-nirodho, n\u0101mar\u016bpa-nirodh\u0101 sa\u1e37\u0101yatana-nirodho, sa\u1e37\u0101yatana-nirodh\u0101 phassa-nirodho, phassa-nirodh\u0101 vedan\u0101-nirodho, vedan\u0101-nirodh\u0101 ta\u1e47h\u0101-nirodho, ta\u1e47h\u0101-nirodh\u0101 up\u0101d\u0101na-nirodho, up\u0101d\u0101na-nirodh\u0101 bhava-nirodho, bhava-nirodh\u0101 j\u0101ti-nirodho, j\u0101ti-nirodh\u0101 jar\u0101-mara\u1e47a\u1e43 soka-parideva-dukkha-domanass'up\u0101y\u0101s\u0101 nirujjhanti. \nBut from the complete fading away and cessation of ignorance there is cessation of volitional formations;

Do **not** return single-word outputs (e.g., \"<b>Anussarati</b>\").\n   - A valid **sutta reference number** (also known as the **sutta number**) must be **explicitly present within the selected sentence**.\n   - **STRICT RULE**: \n      - If the **sutta reference number** (e.g., \"AN 3.71\") is **not found directly in the selected sentence itself**, **discard the selected sentence**.\n   - Remove any **sutta reference number** from the selected sentence (e.g., \"AN 3.71\", \"AN 3.71 (simpl)\", or similar citation formats) once identified.\n   - Store the **sutta reference number** in the `\"class_source\"` field.\n   - **Handling `(simpl)` in `class_source` Formatting:**\n      - If the extracted **sutta reference number** contains **\"(simpl)\"**, preserve it (e.g., `\"DN 19.7 (simpl)\"`).\n      - If **\"(simpl)\"** is **not present**, return only the core sutta number (e.g., `\"DN 19.7\"`).\n\n2. **Ensure Correct Sutta Reference Name Retrieval:**\n   - The **sutta reference name** (also known as the **sutta reference name**) will not be available in the exercise dataset.\n   - After obtaining the **sutta reference number**, retrieve the corresponding **sutta reference name**.\n      - Example: If **sutta reference number** is `\"AN 2.1\"`, the **sutta reference name** should be `\"vajjasutta\u1e43\"`.\n      - If the correct **sutta reference name** cannot be determined, return `\"unknown\"` instead of making an incorrect guess.\n   - Store the **sutta reference name** in the `\"class_sutta\"` field.\n\n3. **Formatting Rule for `\"class_example\"`:**\n   - The **selected Pali word** is **highlighted alone** within `<b>...</b>`.\n   - The capitalization of the entire sentence must remain exactly as in the exercise dataset.\n\n4. **`\"pali\"` Field Rule:**  \n   - The `\"pali\"` field **must always** match the **exact given Pali word**, including numbering if present (e.g., `\"anussarati 1.1\"`).\n   - Even if the extracted sentence contains a different **morphological form**, the `\"pali\"` field must **not** be altered.\n\n5. **`\"explanation\"` Field Rule:**  \n   - The `\"explanation\"` field should provide a brief justification for why the response was generated **if the user asks a question**.\n   - If the user requests a solution, provide a practical suggestion to achieve the desired outcome.\n   - If **no question is provided**, return an **empty string** (`\"\"`).\n\n6. **Output Structure and Formatting:**\n   - If a valid sentence is found and the sutta reference number is explicitly present within it, return the output in **JSON format** with the following structure:\n      {\n         \"id\": \"<Given Pali ID>\",\n         \"pali\": \"<Given Pali word>\",\n         \"selected_pali_word\": \"<Selected Pali word>\",\n         \"class_source\": \"<Sutta Reference Number>\",\n         \"class_sutta\": \"<Sutta Reference Name>\",\n         \"class_example\": \"<A full sentence with <b>Selected Pali word</b> highlighted, preserving original capitalization>\",\n         \"english_translation\": \"<English translation>\",\n         \"explanation\": \"<A justification for why this response was generated and a solution if applicable, or an empty string if no question was asked>\"\n      }\n   - If the sutta reference number is missing from the selected sentence, return an **empty JSON object** `{}`.\n   - If no valid sentence is found, return an **empty JSON object** `{}`.\n\n7. **Strict JSON Output rules:**\n   **IMPORTANT: FOLLOW THESE RULES STRICTLY**\n   - **DO NOT** wrap the JSON output in Markdown formatting (e.g., ` ```json ... ``` `).\n   - **DO NOT** add any extra text before or after the JSON response.\n   - **DO NOT** format the output as a code block.\n   - **ONLY RETURN A PLAIN JSON OBJECT.**\n   - **Failure to follow these rules will result in an invalid response.**\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "\n    For the given Pali word: \"asesa\" with ID: \"9869\",     extract a relevant sentence in exercise data: \"Class 2 Exercises\n\nnamo tassa bhagavato arahato samm\u0101-sambuddhassa\t \t\t\t\t\t\nHomage to him, the Blessed One, the Worthy One, the fully Enlightened One.\n\u2003\navijj\u0101ya tv'eva asesa-vir\u0101ga-nirodh\u0101 sa\u1e45kh\u0101ra-nirodho, sa\u1e45kh\u0101ra-nirodh\u0101 vi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101\u1e47a-nirodho, vi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101\u1e47a-nirodh\u0101 n\u0101mar\u016bpa-nirodho, n\u0101mar\u016bpa-nirodh\u0101 sa\u1e37\u0101yatana-nirodho, sa\u1e37\u0101yatana-nirodh\u0101 phassa-nirodho, phassa-nirodh\u0101 vedan\u0101-nirodho, vedan\u0101-nirodh\u0101 ta\u1e47h\u0101-nirodho, ta\u1e47h\u0101-nirodh\u0101 up\u0101d\u0101na-nirodho, up\u0101d\u0101na-nirodh\u0101 bhava-nirodho, bhava-nirodh\u0101 j\u0101ti-nirodho, j\u0101ti-nirodh\u0101 jar\u0101-mara\u1e47a\u1e43 soka-parideva-dukkha-domanass'up\u0101y\u0101s\u0101 nirujjhanti. \nBut from the complete fading away and cessation of ignorance there is cessation of volitional formations;

Do **not** return single-word outputs (e.g., \"<b>Anussarati</b>\").\n   - A valid **sutta reference number** (also known as the **sutta number**) must be **explicitly present within the selected sentence**.\n   - **STRICT RULE**: \n      - If the **sutta reference number** (e.g., \"AN 3.71\") is **not found directly in the selected sentence itself**, **discard the selected sentence**.\n   - Remove any **sutta reference number** from the selected sentence (e.g., \"AN 3.71\", \"AN 3.71 (simpl)\", or similar citation formats) once identified.\n   - Store the **sutta reference number** in the `\"class_source\"` field.\n   - **Handling `(simpl)` in `class_source` Formatting:**\n      - If the extracted **sutta reference number** contains **\"(simpl)\"**, preserve it (e.g., `\"DN 19.7 (simpl)\"`).\n      - If **\"(simpl)\"** is **not present**, return only the core sutta number (e.g., `\"DN 19.7\"`).\n\n2. **Ensure Correct Sutta Reference Name Retrieval:**\n   - The **sutta reference name** (also known as the **sutta reference name**) will not be available in the exercise dataset.\n   - After obtaining the **sutta reference number**, retrieve the corresponding **sutta reference name**.\n      - Example: If **sutta reference number** is `\"AN 2.1\"`, the **sutta reference name** should be `\"vajjasutta\u1e43\"`.\n      - If the correct **sutta reference name** cannot be determined, return `\"unknown\"` instead of making an incorrect guess.\n   - Store the **sutta reference name** in the `\"class_sutta\"` field.\n\n3. **Formatting Rule for `\"class_example\"`:**\n   - The **selected Pali word** is **highlighted alone** within `<b>...</b>`.\n   - The capitalization of the entire sentence must remain exactly as in the exercise dataset.\n\n4. **`\"pali\"` Field Rule:**  \n   - The `\"pali\"` field **must always** match the **exact given Pali word**, including numbering if present (e.g., `\"anussarati 1.1\"`).\n   - Even if the extracted sentence contains a different **morphological form**, the `\"pali\"` field must **not** be altered.\n\n5. **`\"explanation\"` Field Rule:**  \n   - The `\"explanation\"` field should provide a brief justification for why the response was generated **if the user asks a question**.\n   - If the user requests a solution, provide a practical suggestion to achieve the desired outcome.\n   - If **no question is provided**, return an **empty string** (`\"\"`).\n\n6. **Output Structure and Formatting:**\n   - If a valid sentence is found and the sutta reference number is explicitly present within it, return the output in **JSON format** with the following structure:\n      {\n         \"id\": \"<Given Pali ID>\",\n         \"pali\": \"<Given Pali word>\",\n         \"selected_pali_word\": \"<Selected Pali word>\",\n         \"class_source\": \"<Sutta Reference Number>\",\n         \"class_sutta\": \"<Sutta Reference Name>\",\n         \"class_example\": \"<A full sentence with <b>Selected Pali word</b> highlighted, preserving original capitalization>\",\n         \"english_translation\": \"<English translation>\",\n         \"explanation\": \"<A justification for why this response was generated and a solution if applicable, or an empty string if no question was asked>\"\n      }\n   - If the sutta reference number is missing from the selected sentence, return an **empty JSON object** `{}`.\n   - If no valid sentence is found, return an **empty JSON object** `{}`.\n\n7. **Strict JSON Output rules:**\n   **IMPORTANT: FOLLOW THESE RULES STRICTLY**\n   - **DO NOT** wrap the JSON output in Markdown formatting (e.g., ` ```json ... ``` `).\n   - **DO NOT** add any extra text before or after the JSON response.\n   - **DO NOT** format the output as a code block.\n   - **ONLY RETURN A PLAIN JSON OBJECT.**\n   - **Failure to follow these rules will result in an invalid response.**\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "\n    For the given Pali word: \"\u0101sava 1.2\" with ID: \"12812\",     extract a relevant sentence in exercise data: \"Class 2 Exercises\n\nnamo tassa bhagavato arahato samm\u0101-sambuddhassa\t \t\t\t\t\t\nHomage to him, the Blessed One, the Worthy One, the fully Enlightened One.\n\u2003\navijj\u0101ya tv'eva asesa-vir\u0101ga-nirodh\u0101 sa\u1e45kh\u0101ra-nirodho, sa\u1e45kh\u0101ra-nirodh\u0101 vi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101\u1e47a-nirodho, vi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101\u1e47a-nirodh\u0101 n\u0101mar\u016bpa-nirodho, n\u0101mar\u016bpa-nirodh\u0101 sa\u1e37\u0101yatana-nirodho, sa\u1e37\u0101yatana-nirodh\u0101 phassa-nirodho, phassa-nirodh\u0101 vedan\u0101-nirodho, vedan\u0101-nirodh\u0101 ta\u1e47h\u0101-nirodho, ta\u1e47h\u0101-nirodh\u0101 up\u0101d\u0101na-nirodho, up\u0101d\u0101na-nirodh\u0101 bhava-nirodho, bhava-nirodh\u0101 j\u0101ti-nirodho, j\u0101ti-nirodh\u0101 jar\u0101-mara\u1e47a\u1e43 soka-parideva-dukkha-domanass'up\u0101y\u0101s\u0101 nirujjhanti. \nBut from the complete fading away and cessation of ignorance there is cessation of volitional formations;

Do **not** return single-word outputs (e.g., \"<b>Anussarati</b>\").\n   - A valid **sutta reference number** (also known as the **sutta number**) must be **explicitly present within the selected sentence**.\n   - **STRICT RULE**: \n      - If the **sutta reference number** (e.g., \"AN 3.71\") is **not found directly in the selected sentence itself**, **discard the selected sentence**.\n   - Remove any **sutta reference number** from the selected sentence (e.g., \"AN 3.71\", \"AN 3.71 (simpl)\", or similar citation formats) once identified.\n   - Store the **sutta reference number** in the `\"class_source\"` field.\n   - **Handling `(simpl)` in `class_source` Formatting:**\n      - If the extracted **sutta reference number** contains **\"(simpl)\"**, preserve it (e.g., `\"DN 19.7 (simpl)\"`).\n      - If **\"(simpl)\"** is **not present**, return only the core sutta number (e.g., `\"DN 19.7\"`).\n\n2. **Ensure Correct Sutta Reference Name Retrieval:**\n   - The **sutta reference name** (also known as the **sutta reference name**) will not be available in the exercise dataset.\n   - After obtaining the **sutta reference number**, retrieve the corresponding **sutta reference name**.\n      - Example: If **sutta reference number** is `\"AN 2.1\"`, the **sutta reference name** should be `\"vajjasutta\u1e43\"`.\n      - If the correct **sutta reference name** cannot be determined, return `\"unknown\"` instead of making an incorrect guess.\n   - Store the **sutta reference name** in the `\"class_sutta\"` field.\n\n3. **Formatting Rule for `\"class_example\"`:**\n   - The **selected Pali word** is **highlighted alone** within `<b>...</b>`.\n   - The capitalization of the entire sentence must remain exactly as in the exercise dataset.\n\n4. **`\"pali\"` Field Rule:**  \n   - The `\"pali\"` field **must always** match the **exact given Pali word**, including numbering if present (e.g., `\"anussarati 1.1\"`).\n   - Even if the extracted sentence contains a different **morphological form**, the `\"pali\"` field must **not** be altered.\n\n5. **`\"explanation\"` Field Rule:**  \n   - The `\"explanation\"` field should provide a brief justification for why the response was generated **if the user asks a question**.\n   - If the user requests a solution, provide a practical suggestion to achieve the desired outcome.\n   - If **no question is provided**, return an **empty string** (`\"\"`).\n\n6. **Output Structure and Formatting:**\n   - If a valid sentence is found and the sutta reference number is explicitly present within it, return the output in **JSON format** with the following structure:\n      {\n         \"id\": \"<Given Pali ID>\",\n         \"pali\": \"<Given Pali word>\",\n         \"selected_pali_word\": \"<Selected Pali word>\",\n         \"class_source\": \"<Sutta Reference Number>\",\n         \"class_sutta\": \"<Sutta Reference Name>\",\n         \"class_example\": \"<A full sentence with <b>Selected Pali word</b> highlighted, preserving original capitalization>\",\n         \"english_translation\": \"<English translation>\",\n         \"explanation\": \"<A justification for why this response was generated and a solution if applicable, or an empty string if no question was asked>\"\n      }\n   - If the sutta reference number is missing from the selected sentence, return an **empty JSON object** `{}`.\n   - If no valid sentence is found, return an **empty JSON object** `{}`.\n\n7. **Strict JSON Output rules:**\n   **IMPORTANT: FOLLOW THESE RULES STRICTLY**\n   - **DO NOT** wrap the JSON output in Markdown formatting (e.g., ` ```json ... ``` `).\n   - **DO NOT** add any extra text before or after the JSON response.\n   - **DO NOT** format the output as a code block.\n   - **ONLY RETURN A PLAIN JSON OBJECT.**\n   - **Failure to follow these rules will result in an invalid response.**\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "\n    For the given Pali word: \"uttari 1.1\" with ID: \"14712\",     extract a relevant sentence in exercise data: \"Class 2 Exercises\n\nnamo tassa bhagavato arahato samm\u0101-sambuddhassa\t \t\t\t\t\t\nHomage to him, the Blessed One, the Worthy One, the fully Enlightened One.\n\u2003\navijj\u0101ya tv'eva asesa-vir\u0101ga-nirodh\u0101 sa\u1e45kh\u0101ra-nirodho, sa\u1e45kh\u0101ra-nirodh\u0101 vi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101\u1e47a-nirodho, vi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101\u1e47a-nirodh\u0101 n\u0101mar\u016bpa-nirodho, n\u0101mar\u016bpa-nirodh\u0101 sa\u1e37\u0101yatana-nirodho, sa\u1e37\u0101yatana-nirodh\u0101 phassa-nirodho, phassa-nirodh\u0101 vedan\u0101-nirodho, vedan\u0101-nirodh\u0101 ta\u1e47h\u0101-nirodho, ta\u1e47h\u0101-nirodh\u0101 up\u0101d\u0101na-nirodho, up\u0101d\u0101na-nirodh\u0101 bhava-nirodho, bhava-nirodh\u0101 j\u0101ti-nirodho, j\u0101ti-nirodh\u0101 jar\u0101-mara\u1e47a\u1e43 soka-parideva-dukkha-domanass'up\u0101y\u0101s\u0101 nirujjhanti. \nBut from the complete fading away and cessation of ignorance there is cessation of volitional formations;

Do **not** return single-word outputs (e.g., \"<b>Anussarati</b>\").\n   - A valid **sutta reference number** (also known as the **sutta number**) must be **explicitly present within the selected sentence**.\n   - **STRICT RULE**: \n      - If the **sutta reference number** (e.g., \"AN 3.71\") is **not found directly in the selected sentence itself**, **discard the selected sentence**.\n   - Remove any **sutta reference number** from the selected sentence (e.g., \"AN 3.71\", \"AN 3.71 (simpl)\", or similar citation formats) once identified.\n   - Store the **sutta reference number** in the `\"class_source\"` field.\n   - **Handling `(simpl)` in `class_source` Formatting:**\n      - If the extracted **sutta reference number** contains **\"(simpl)\"**, preserve it (e.g., `\"DN 19.7 (simpl)\"`).\n      - If **\"(simpl)\"** is **not present**, return only the core sutta number (e.g., `\"DN 19.7\"`).\n\n2. **Ensure Correct Sutta Reference Name Retrieval:**\n   - The **sutta reference name** (also known as the **sutta reference name**) will not be available in the exercise dataset.\n   - After obtaining the **sutta reference number**, retrieve the corresponding **sutta reference name**.\n      - Example: If **sutta reference number** is `\"AN 2.1\"`, the **sutta reference name** should be `\"vajjasutta\u1e43\"`.\n      - If the correct **sutta reference name** cannot be determined, return `\"unknown\"` instead of making an incorrect guess.\n   - Store the **sutta reference name** in the `\"class_sutta\"` field.\n\n3. **Formatting Rule for `\"class_example\"`:**\n   - The **selected Pali word** is **highlighted alone** within `<b>...</b>`.\n   - The capitalization of the entire sentence must remain exactly as in the exercise dataset.\n\n4. **`\"pali\"` Field Rule:**  \n   - The `\"pali\"` field **must always** match the **exact given Pali word**, including numbering if present (e.g., `\"anussarati 1.1\"`).\n   - Even if the extracted sentence contains a different **morphological form**, the `\"pali\"` field must **not** be altered.\n\n5. **`\"explanation\"` Field Rule:**  \n   - The `\"explanation\"` field should provide a brief justification for why the response was generated **if the user asks a question**.\n   - If the user requests a solution, provide a practical suggestion to achieve the desired outcome.\n   - If **no question is provided**, return an **empty string** (`\"\"`).\n\n6. **Output Structure and Formatting:**\n   - If a valid sentence is found and the sutta reference number is explicitly present within it, return the output in **JSON format** with the following structure:\n      {\n         \"id\": \"<Given Pali ID>\",\n         \"pali\": \"<Given Pali word>\",\n         \"selected_pali_word\": \"<Selected Pali word>\",\n         \"class_source\": \"<Sutta Reference Number>\",\n         \"class_sutta\": \"<Sutta Reference Name>\",\n         \"class_example\": \"<A full sentence with <b>Selected Pali word</b> highlighted, preserving original capitalization>\",\n         \"english_translation\": \"<English translation>\",\n         \"explanation\": \"<A justification for why this response was generated and a solution if applicable, or an empty string if no question was asked>\"\n      }\n   - If the sutta reference number is missing from the selected sentence, return an **empty JSON object** `{}`.\n   - If no valid sentence is found, return an **empty JSON object** `{}`.\n\n7. **Strict JSON Output rules:**\n   **IMPORTANT: FOLLOW THESE RULES STRICTLY**\n   - **DO NOT** wrap the JSON output in Markdown formatting (e.g., ` ```json ... ``` `).\n   - **DO NOT** add any extra text before or after the JSON response.\n   - **DO NOT** format the output as a code block.\n   - **ONLY RETURN A PLAIN JSON OBJECT.**\n   - **Failure to follow these rules will result in an invalid response.**\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "\n    For the given Pali word: \"up\u0101d\u0101na 2\" with ID: \"16316\",     extract a relevant sentence in exercise data: \"Class 2 Exercises\n\nnamo tassa bhagavato arahato samm\u0101-sambuddhassa\t \t\t\t\t\t\nHomage to him, the Blessed One, the Worthy One, the fully Enlightened One.\n\u2003\navijj\u0101ya tv'eva asesa-vir\u0101ga-nirodh\u0101 sa\u1e45kh\u0101ra-nirodho, sa\u1e45kh\u0101ra-nirodh\u0101 vi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101\u1e47a-nirodho, vi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101\u1e47a-nirodh\u0101 n\u0101mar\u016bpa-nirodho, n\u0101mar\u016bpa-nirodh\u0101 sa\u1e37\u0101yatana-nirodho, sa\u1e37\u0101yatana-nirodh\u0101 phassa-nirodho, phassa-nirodh\u0101 vedan\u0101-nirodho, vedan\u0101-nirodh\u0101 ta\u1e47h\u0101-nirodho, ta\u1e47h\u0101-nirodh\u0101 up\u0101d\u0101na-nirodho, up\u0101d\u0101na-nirodh\u0101 bhava-nirodho, bhava-nirodh\u0101 j\u0101ti-nirodho, j\u0101ti-nirodh\u0101 jar\u0101-mara\u1e47a\u1e43 soka-parideva-dukkha-domanass'up\u0101y\u0101s\u0101 nirujjhanti. \nBut from the complete fading away and cessation of ignorance there is cessation of volitional formations;

Do **not** return single-word outputs (e.g., \"<b>Anussarati</b>\").\n   - A valid **sutta reference number** (also known as the **sutta number**) must be **explicitly present within the selected sentence**.\n   - **STRICT RULE**: \n      - If the **sutta reference number** (e.g., \"AN 3.71\") is **not found directly in the selected sentence itself**, **discard the selected sentence**.\n   - Remove any **sutta reference number** from the selected sentence (e.g., \"AN 3.71\", \"AN 3.71 (simpl)\", or similar citation formats) once identified.\n   - Store the **sutta reference number** in the `\"class_source\"` field.\n   - **Handling `(simpl)` in `class_source` Formatting:**\n      - If the extracted **sutta reference number** contains **\"(simpl)\"**, preserve it (e.g., `\"DN 19.7 (simpl)\"`).\n      - If **\"(simpl)\"** is **not present**, return only the core sutta number (e.g., `\"DN 19.7\"`).\n\n2. **Ensure Correct Sutta Reference Name Retrieval:**\n   - The **sutta reference name** (also known as the **sutta reference name**) will not be available in the exercise dataset.\n   - After obtaining the **sutta reference number**, retrieve the corresponding **sutta reference name**.\n      - Example: If **sutta reference number** is `\"AN 2.1\"`, the **sutta reference name** should be `\"vajjasutta\u1e43\"`.\n      - If the correct **sutta reference name** cannot be determined, return `\"unknown\"` instead of making an incorrect guess.\n   - Store the **sutta reference name** in the `\"class_sutta\"` field.\n\n3. **Formatting Rule for `\"class_example\"`:**\n   - The **selected Pali word** is **highlighted alone** within `<b>...</b>`.\n   - The capitalization of the entire sentence must remain exactly as in the exercise dataset.\n\n4. **`\"pali\"` Field Rule:**  \n   - The `\"pali\"` field **must always** match the **exact given Pali word**, including numbering if present (e.g., `\"anussarati 1.1\"`).\n   - Even if the extracted sentence contains a different **morphological form**, the `\"pali\"` field must **not** be altered.\n\n5. **`\"explanation\"` Field Rule:**  \n   - The `\"explanation\"` field should provide a brief justification for why the response was generated **if the user asks a question**.\n   - If the user requests a solution, provide a practical suggestion to achieve the desired outcome.\n   - If **no question is provided**, return an **empty string** (`\"\"`).\n\n6. **Output Structure and Formatting:**\n   - If a valid sentence is found and the sutta reference number is explicitly present within it, return the output in **JSON format** with the following structure:\n      {\n         \"id\": \"<Given Pali ID>\",\n         \"pali\": \"<Given Pali word>\",\n         \"selected_pali_word\": \"<Selected Pali word>\",\n         \"class_source\": \"<Sutta Reference Number>\",\n         \"class_sutta\": \"<Sutta Reference Name>\",\n         \"class_example\": \"<A full sentence with <b>Selected Pali word</b> highlighted, preserving original capitalization>\",\n         \"english_translation\": \"<English translation>\",\n         \"explanation\": \"<A justification for why this response was generated and a solution if applicable, or an empty string if no question was asked>\"\n      }\n   - If the sutta reference number is missing from the selected sentence, return an **empty JSON object** `{}`.\n   - If no valid sentence is found, return an **empty JSON object** `{}`.\n\n7. **Strict JSON Output rules:**\n   **IMPORTANT: FOLLOW THESE RULES STRICTLY**\n   - **DO NOT** wrap the JSON output in Markdown formatting (e.g., ` ```json ... ``` `).\n   - **DO NOT** add any extra text before or after the JSON response.\n   - **DO NOT** format the output as a code block.\n   - **ONLY RETURN A PLAIN JSON OBJECT.**\n   - **Failure to follow these rules will result in an invalid response.**\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "\n    For the given Pali word: \"uposatha 1\" with ID: \"16502\",     extract a relevant sentence in exercise data: \"Class 2 Exercises\n\nnamo tassa bhagavato arahato samm\u0101-sambuddhassa\t \t\t\t\t\t\nHomage to him, the Blessed One, the Worthy One, the fully Enlightened One.\n\u2003\navijj\u0101ya tv'eva asesa-vir\u0101ga-nirodh\u0101 sa\u1e45kh\u0101ra-nirodho, sa\u1e45kh\u0101ra-nirodh\u0101 vi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101\u1e47a-nirodho, vi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101\u1e47a-nirodh\u0101 n\u0101mar\u016bpa-nirodho, n\u0101mar\u016bpa-nirodh\u0101 sa\u1e37\u0101yatana-nirodho, sa\u1e37\u0101yatana-nirodh\u0101 phassa-nirodho, phassa-nirodh\u0101 vedan\u0101-nirodho, vedan\u0101-nirodh\u0101 ta\u1e47h\u0101-nirodho, ta\u1e47h\u0101-nirodh\u0101 up\u0101d\u0101na-nirodho, up\u0101d\u0101na-nirodh\u0101 bhava-nirodho, bhava-nirodh\u0101 j\u0101ti-nirodho, j\u0101ti-nirodh\u0101 jar\u0101-mara\u1e47a\u1e43 soka-parideva-dukkha-domanass'up\u0101y\u0101s\u0101 nirujjhanti. \nBut from the complete fading away and cessation of ignorance there is cessation of volitional formations;

Do **not** return single-word outputs (e.g., \"<b>Anussarati</b>\").\n   - A valid **sutta reference number** (also known as the **sutta number**) must be **explicitly present within the selected sentence**.\n   - **STRICT RULE**: \n      - If the **sutta reference number** (e.g., \"AN 3.71\") is **not found directly in the selected sentence itself**, **discard the selected sentence**.\n   - Remove any **sutta reference number** from the selected sentence (e.g., \"AN 3.71\", \"AN 3.71 (simpl)\", or similar citation formats) once identified.\n   - Store the **sutta reference number** in the `\"class_source\"` field.\n   - **Handling `(simpl)` in `class_source` Formatting:**\n      - If the extracted **sutta reference number** contains **\"(simpl)\"**, preserve it (e.g., `\"DN 19.7 (simpl)\"`).\n      - If **\"(simpl)\"** is **not present**, return only the core sutta number (e.g., `\"DN 19.7\"`).\n\n2. **Ensure Correct Sutta Reference Name Retrieval:**\n   - The **sutta reference name** (also known as the **sutta reference name**) will not be available in the exercise dataset.\n   - After obtaining the **sutta reference number**, retrieve the corresponding **sutta reference name**.\n      - Example: If **sutta reference number** is `\"AN 2.1\"`, the **sutta reference name** should be `\"vajjasutta\u1e43\"`.\n      - If the correct **sutta reference name** cannot be determined, return `\"unknown\"` instead of making an incorrect guess.\n   - Store the **sutta reference name** in the `\"class_sutta\"` field.\n\n3. **Formatting Rule for `\"class_example\"`:**\n   - The **selected Pali word** is **highlighted alone** within `<b>...</b>`.\n   - The capitalization of the entire sentence must remain exactly as in the exercise dataset.\n\n4. **`\"pali\"` Field Rule:**  \n   - The `\"pali\"` field **must always** match the **exact given Pali word**, including numbering if present (e.g., `\"anussarati 1.1\"`).\n   - Even if the extracted sentence contains a different **morphological form**, the `\"pali\"` field must **not** be altered.\n\n5. **`\"explanation\"` Field Rule:**  \n   - The `\"explanation\"` field should provide a brief justification for why the response was generated **if the user asks a question**.\n   - If the user requests a solution, provide a practical suggestion to achieve the desired outcome.\n   - If **no question is provided**, return an **empty string** (`\"\"`).\n\n6. **Output Structure and Formatting:**\n   - If a valid sentence is found and the sutta reference number is explicitly present within it, return the output in **JSON format** with the following structure:\n      {\n         \"id\": \"<Given Pali ID>\",\n         \"pali\": \"<Given Pali word>\",\n         \"selected_pali_word\": \"<Selected Pali word>\",\n         \"class_source\": \"<Sutta Reference Number>\",\n         \"class_sutta\": \"<Sutta Reference Name>\",\n         \"class_example\": \"<A full sentence with <b>Selected Pali word</b> highlighted, preserving original capitalization>\",\n         \"english_translation\": \"<English translation>\",\n         \"explanation\": \"<A justification for why this response was generated and a solution if applicable, or an empty string if no question was asked>\"\n      }\n   - If the sutta reference number is missing from the selected sentence, return an **empty JSON object** `{}`.\n   - If no valid sentence is found, return an **empty JSON object** `{}`.\n\n7. **Strict JSON Output rules:**\n   **IMPORTANT: FOLLOW THESE RULES STRICTLY**\n   - **DO NOT** wrap the JSON output in Markdown formatting (e.g., ` ```json ... ``` `).\n   - **DO NOT** add any extra text before or after the JSON response.\n   - **DO NOT** format the output as a code block.\n   - **ONLY RETURN A PLAIN JSON OBJECT.**\n   - **Failure to follow these rules will result in an invalid response.**\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "\n    For the given Pali word: \"ehi\" with ID: \"18216\",     extract a relevant sentence in exercise data: \"Class 2 Exercises\n\nnamo tassa bhagavato arahato samm\u0101-sambuddhassa\t \t\t\t\t\t\nHomage to him, the Blessed One, the Worthy One, the fully Enlightened One.\n\u2003\navijj\u0101ya tv'eva asesa-vir\u0101ga-nirodh\u0101 sa\u1e45kh\u0101ra-nirodho, sa\u1e45kh\u0101ra-nirodh\u0101 vi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101\u1e47a-nirodho, vi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101\u1e47a-nirodh\u0101 n\u0101mar\u016bpa-nirodho, n\u0101mar\u016bpa-nirodh\u0101 sa\u1e37\u0101yatana-nirodho, sa\u1e37\u0101yatana-nirodh\u0101 phassa-nirodho, phassa-nirodh\u0101 vedan\u0101-nirodho, vedan\u0101-nirodh\u0101 ta\u1e47h\u0101-nirodho, ta\u1e47h\u0101-nirodh\u0101 up\u0101d\u0101na-nirodho, up\u0101d\u0101na-nirodh\u0101 bhava-nirodho, bhava-nirodh\u0101 j\u0101ti-nirodho, j\u0101ti-nirodh\u0101 jar\u0101-mara\u1e47a\u1e43 soka-parideva-dukkha-domanass'up\u0101y\u0101s\u0101 nirujjhanti. \nBut from the complete fading away and cessation of ignorance there is cessation of volitional formations;

Do **not** return single-word outputs (e.g., \"<b>Anussarati</b>\").\n   - A valid **sutta reference number** (also known as the **sutta number**) must be **explicitly present within the selected sentence**.\n   - **STRICT RULE**: \n      - If the **sutta reference number** (e.g., \"AN 3.71\") is **not found directly in the selected sentence itself**, **discard the selected sentence**.\n   - Remove any **sutta reference number** from the selected sentence (e.g., \"AN 3.71\", \"AN 3.71 (simpl)\", or similar citation formats) once identified.\n   - Store the **sutta reference number** in the `\"class_source\"` field.\n   - **Handling `(simpl)` in `class_source` Formatting:**\n      - If the extracted **sutta reference number** contains **\"(simpl)\"**, preserve it (e.g., `\"DN 19.7 (simpl)\"`).\n      - If **\"(simpl)\"** is **not present**, return only the core sutta number (e.g., `\"DN 19.7\"`).\n\n2. **Ensure Correct Sutta Reference Name Retrieval:**\n   - The **sutta reference name** (also known as the **sutta reference name**) will not be available in the exercise dataset.\n   - After obtaining the **sutta reference number**, retrieve the corresponding **sutta reference name**.\n      - Example: If **sutta reference number** is `\"AN 2.1\"`, the **sutta reference name** should be `\"vajjasutta\u1e43\"`.\n      - If the correct **sutta reference name** cannot be determined, return `\"unknown\"` instead of making an incorrect guess.\n   - Store the **sutta reference name** in the `\"class_sutta\"` field.\n\n3. **Formatting Rule for `\"class_example\"`:**\n   - The **selected Pali word** is **highlighted alone** within `<b>...</b>`.\n   - The capitalization of the entire sentence must remain exactly as in the exercise dataset.\n\n4. **`\"pali\"` Field Rule:**  \n   - The `\"pali\"` field **must always** match the **exact given Pali word**, including numbering if present (e.g., `\"anussarati 1.1\"`).\n   - Even if the extracted sentence contains a different **morphological form**, the `\"pali\"` field must **not** be altered.\n\n5. **`\"explanation\"` Field Rule:**  \n   - The `\"explanation\"` field should provide a brief justification for why the response was generated **if the user asks a question**.\n   - If the user requests a solution, provide a practical suggestion to achieve the desired outcome.\n   - If **no question is provided**, return an **empty string** (`\"\"`).\n\n6. **Output Structure and Formatting:**\n   - If a valid sentence is found and the sutta reference number is explicitly present within it, return the output in **JSON format** with the following structure:\n      {\n         \"id\": \"<Given Pali ID>\",\n         \"pali\": \"<Given Pali word>\",\n         \"selected_pali_word\": \"<Selected Pali word>\",\n         \"class_source\": \"<Sutta Reference Number>\",\n         \"class_sutta\": \"<Sutta Reference Name>\",\n         \"class_example\": \"<A full sentence with <b>Selected Pali word</b> highlighted, preserving original capitalization>\",\n         \"english_translation\": \"<English translation>\",\n         \"explanation\": \"<A justification for why this response was generated and a solution if applicable, or an empty string if no question was asked>\"\n      }\n   - If the sutta reference number is missing from the selected sentence, return an **empty JSON object** `{}`.\n   - If no valid sentence is found, return an **empty JSON object** `{}`.\n\n7. **Strict JSON Output rules:**\n   **IMPORTANT: FOLLOW THESE RULES STRICTLY**\n   - **DO NOT** wrap the JSON output in Markdown formatting (e.g., ` ```json ... ``` `).\n   - **DO NOT** add any extra text before or after the JSON response.\n   - **DO NOT** format the output as a code block.\n   - **ONLY RETURN A PLAIN JSON OBJECT.**\n   - **Failure to follow these rules will result in an invalid response.**\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "\n    For the given Pali word: \"k\u0101ma 3\" with ID: \"20959\",     extract a relevant sentence in exercise data: \"Class 2 Exercises\n\nnamo tassa bhagavato arahato samm\u0101-sambuddhassa\t \t\t\t\t\t\nHomage to him, the Blessed One, the Worthy One, the fully Enlightened One.\n\u2003\navijj\u0101ya tv'eva asesa-vir\u0101ga-nirodh\u0101 sa\u1e45kh\u0101ra-nirodho, sa\u1e45kh\u0101ra-nirodh\u0101 vi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101\u1e47a-nirodho, vi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101\u1e47a-nirodh\u0101 n\u0101mar\u016bpa-nirodho, n\u0101mar\u016bpa-nirodh\u0101 sa\u1e37\u0101yatana-nirodho, sa\u1e37\u0101yatana-nirodh\u0101 phassa-nirodho, phassa-nirodh\u0101 vedan\u0101-nirodho, vedan\u0101-nirodh\u0101 ta\u1e47h\u0101-nirodho, ta\u1e47h\u0101-nirodh\u0101 up\u0101d\u0101na-nirodho, up\u0101d\u0101na-nirodh\u0101 bhava-nirodho, bhava-nirodh\u0101 j\u0101ti-nirodho, j\u0101ti-nirodh\u0101 jar\u0101-mara\u1e47a\u1e43 soka-parideva-dukkha-domanass'up\u0101y\u0101s\u0101 nirujjhanti. \nBut from the complete fading away and cessation of ignorance there is cessation of volitional formations;

Do **not** return single-word outputs (e.g., \"<b>Anussarati</b>\").\n   - A valid **sutta reference number** (also known as the **sutta number**) must be **explicitly present within the selected sentence**.\n   - **STRICT RULE**: \n      - If the **sutta reference number** (e.g., \"AN 3.71\") is **not found directly in the selected sentence itself**, **discard the selected sentence**.\n   - Remove any **sutta reference number** from the selected sentence (e.g., \"AN 3.71\", \"AN 3.71 (simpl)\", or similar citation formats) once identified.\n   - Store the **sutta reference number** in the `\"class_source\"` field.\n   - **Handling `(simpl)` in `class_source` Formatting:**\n      - If the extracted **sutta reference number** contains **\"(simpl)\"**, preserve it (e.g., `\"DN 19.7 (simpl)\"`).\n      - If **\"(simpl)\"** is **not present**, return only the core sutta number (e.g., `\"DN 19.7\"`).\n\n2. **Ensure Correct Sutta Reference Name Retrieval:**\n   - The **sutta reference name** (also known as the **sutta reference name**) will not be available in the exercise dataset.\n   - After obtaining the **sutta reference number**, retrieve the corresponding **sutta reference name**.\n      - Example: If **sutta reference number** is `\"AN 2.1\"`, the **sutta reference name** should be `\"vajjasutta\u1e43\"`.\n      - If the correct **sutta reference name** cannot be determined, return `\"unknown\"` instead of making an incorrect guess.\n   - Store the **sutta reference name** in the `\"class_sutta\"` field.\n\n3. **Formatting Rule for `\"class_example\"`:**\n   - The **selected Pali word** is **highlighted alone** within `<b>...</b>`.\n   - The capitalization of the entire sentence must remain exactly as in the exercise dataset.\n\n4. **`\"pali\"` Field Rule:**  \n   - The `\"pali\"` field **must always** match the **exact given Pali word**, including numbering if present (e.g., `\"anussarati 1.1\"`).\n   - Even if the extracted sentence contains a different **morphological form**, the `\"pali\"` field must **not** be altered.\n\n5. **`\"explanation\"` Field Rule:**  \n   - The `\"explanation\"` field should provide a brief justification for why the response was generated **if the user asks a question**.\n   - If the user requests a solution, provide a practical suggestion to achieve the desired outcome.\n   - If **no question is provided**, return an **empty string** (`\"\"`).\n\n6. **Output Structure and Formatting:**\n   - If a valid sentence is found and the sutta reference number is explicitly present within it, return the output in **JSON format** with the following structure:\n      {\n         \"id\": \"<Given Pali ID>\",\n         \"pali\": \"<Given Pali word>\",\n         \"selected_pali_word\": \"<Selected Pali word>\",\n         \"class_source\": \"<Sutta Reference Number>\",\n         \"class_sutta\": \"<Sutta Reference Name>\",\n         \"class_example\": \"<A full sentence with <b>Selected Pali word</b> highlighted, preserving original capitalization>\",\n         \"english_translation\": \"<English translation>\",\n         \"explanation\": \"<A justification for why this response was generated and a solution if applicable, or an empty string if no question was asked>\"\n      }\n   - If the sutta reference number is missing from the selected sentence, return an **empty JSON object** `{}`.\n   - If no valid sentence is found, return an **empty JSON object** `{}`.\n\n7. **Strict JSON Output rules:**\n   **IMPORTANT: FOLLOW THESE RULES STRICTLY**\n   - **DO NOT** wrap the JSON output in Markdown formatting (e.g., ` ```json ... ``` `).\n   - **DO NOT** add any extra text before or after the JSON response.\n   - **DO NOT** format the output as a code block.\n   - **ONLY RETURN A PLAIN JSON OBJECT.**\n   - **Failure to follow these rules will result in an invalid response.**\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "\n    For the given Pali word: \"k\u0101ya 1.1\" with ID: \"21131\",     extract a relevant sentence in exercise data: \"Class 2 Exercises\n\nnamo tassa bhagavato arahato samm\u0101-sambuddhassa\t \t\t\t\t\t\nHomage to him, the Blessed One, the Worthy One, the fully Enlightened One.\n\u2003\navijj\u0101ya tv'eva asesa-vir\u0101ga-nirodh\u0101 sa\u1e45kh\u0101ra-nirodho, sa\u1e45kh\u0101ra-nirodh\u0101 vi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101\u1e47a-nirodho, vi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101\u1e47a-nirodh\u0101 n\u0101mar\u016bpa-nirodho, n\u0101mar\u016bpa-nirodh\u0101 sa\u1e37\u0101yatana-nirodho, sa\u1e37\u0101yatana-nirodh\u0101 phassa-nirodho, phassa-nirodh\u0101 vedan\u0101-nirodho, vedan\u0101-nirodh\u0101 ta\u1e47h\u0101-nirodho, ta\u1e47h\u0101-nirodh\u0101 up\u0101d\u0101na-nirodho, up\u0101d\u0101na-nirodh\u0101 bhava-nirodho, bhava-nirodh\u0101 j\u0101ti-nirodho, j\u0101ti-nirodh\u0101 jar\u0101-mara\u1e47a\u1e43 soka-parideva-dukkha-domanass'up\u0101y\u0101s\u0101 nirujjhanti. \nBut from the complete fading away and cessation of ignorance there is cessation of volitional formations;

Do **not** return single-word outputs (e.g., \"<b>Anussarati</b>\").\n   - A valid **sutta reference number** (also known as the **sutta number**) must be **explicitly present within the selected sentence**.\n   - **STRICT RULE**: \n      - If the **sutta reference number** (e.g., \"AN 3.71\") is **not found directly in the selected sentence itself**, **discard the selected sentence**.\n   - Remove any **sutta reference number** from the selected sentence (e.g., \"AN 3.71\", \"AN 3.71 (simpl)\", or similar citation formats) once identified.\n   - Store the **sutta reference number** in the `\"class_source\"` field.\n   - **Handling `(simpl)` in `class_source` Formatting:**\n      - If the extracted **sutta reference number** contains **\"(simpl)\"**, preserve it (e.g., `\"DN 19.7 (simpl)\"`).\n      - If **\"(simpl)\"** is **not present**, return only the core sutta number (e.g., `\"DN 19.7\"`).\n\n2. **Ensure Correct Sutta Reference Name Retrieval:**\n   - The **sutta reference name** (also known as the **sutta reference name**) will not be available in the exercise dataset.\n   - After obtaining the **sutta reference number**, retrieve the corresponding **sutta reference name**.\n      - Example: If **sutta reference number** is `\"AN 2.1\"`, the **sutta reference name** should be `\"vajjasutta\u1e43\"`.\n      - If the correct **sutta reference name** cannot be determined, return `\"unknown\"` instead of making an incorrect guess.\n   - Store the **sutta reference name** in the `\"class_sutta\"` field.\n\n3. **Formatting Rule for `\"class_example\"`:**\n   - The **selected Pali word** is **highlighted alone** within `<b>...</b>`.\n   - The capitalization of the entire sentence must remain exactly as in the exercise dataset.\n\n4. **`\"pali\"` Field Rule:**  \n   - The `\"pali\"` field **must always** match the **exact given Pali word**, including numbering if present (e.g., `\"anussarati 1.1\"`).\n   - Even if the extracted sentence contains a different **morphological form**, the `\"pali\"` field must **not** be altered.\n\n5. **`\"explanation\"` Field Rule:**  \n   - The `\"explanation\"` field should provide a brief justification for why the response was generated **if the user asks a question**.\n   - If the user requests a solution, provide a practical suggestion to achieve the desired outcome.\n   - If **no question is provided**, return an **empty string** (`\"\"`).\n\n6. **Output Structure and Formatting:**\n   - If a valid sentence is found and the sutta reference number is explicitly present within it, return the output in **JSON format** with the following structure:\n      {\n         \"id\": \"<Given Pali ID>\",\n         \"pali\": \"<Given Pali word>\",\n         \"selected_pali_word\": \"<Selected Pali word>\",\n         \"class_source\": \"<Sutta Reference Number>\",\n         \"class_sutta\": \"<Sutta Reference Name>\",\n         \"class_example\": \"<A full sentence with <b>Selected Pali word</b> highlighted, preserving original capitalization>\",\n         \"english_translation\": \"<English translation>\",\n         \"explanation\": \"<A justification for why this response was generated and a solution if applicable, or an empty string if no question was asked>\"\n      }\n   - If the sutta reference number is missing from the selected sentence, return an **empty JSON object** `{}`.\n   - If no valid sentence is found, return an **empty JSON object** `{}`.\n\n7. **Strict JSON Output rules:**\n   **IMPORTANT: FOLLOW THESE RULES STRICTLY**\n   - **DO NOT** wrap the JSON output in Markdown formatting (e.g., ` ```json ... ``` `).\n   - **DO NOT** add any extra text before or after the JSON response.\n   - **DO NOT** format the output as a code block.\n   - **ONLY RETURN A PLAIN JSON OBJECT.**\n   - **Failure to follow these rules will result in an invalid response.**\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "\n    For the given Pali word: \"kesa 1\" with ID: \"22853\",     extract a relevant sentence in exercise data: \"Class 2 Exercises\n\nnamo tassa bhagavato arahato samm\u0101-sambuddhassa\t \t\t\t\t\t\nHomage to him, the Blessed One, the Worthy One, the fully Enlightened One.\n\u2003\navijj\u0101ya tv'eva asesa-vir\u0101ga-nirodh\u0101 sa\u1e45kh\u0101ra-nirodho, sa\u1e45kh\u0101ra-nirodh\u0101 vi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101\u1e47a-nirodho, vi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101\u1e47a-nirodh\u0101 n\u0101mar\u016bpa-nirodho, n\u0101mar\u016bpa-nirodh\u0101 sa\u1e37\u0101yatana-nirodho, sa\u1e37\u0101yatana-nirodh\u0101 phassa-nirodho, phassa-nirodh\u0101 vedan\u0101-nirodho, vedan\u0101-nirodh\u0101 ta\u1e47h\u0101-nirodho, ta\u1e47h\u0101-nirodh\u0101 up\u0101d\u0101na-nirodho, up\u0101d\u0101na-nirodh\u0101 bhava-nirodho, bhava-nirodh\u0101 j\u0101ti-nirodho, j\u0101ti-nirodh\u0101 jar\u0101-mara\u1e47a\u1e43 soka-parideva-dukkha-domanass'up\u0101y\u0101s\u0101 nirujjhanti. \nBut from the complete fading away and cessation of ignorance there is cessation of volitional formations;

Do **not** return single-word outputs (e.g., \"<b>Anussarati</b>\").\n   - A valid **sutta reference number** (also known as the **sutta number**) must be **explicitly present within the selected sentence**.\n   - **STRICT RULE**: \n      - If the **sutta reference number** (e.g., \"AN 3.71\") is **not found directly in the selected sentence itself**, **discard the selected sentence**.\n   - Remove any **sutta reference number** from the selected sentence (e.g., \"AN 3.71\", \"AN 3.71 (simpl)\", or similar citation formats) once identified.\n   - Store the **sutta reference number** in the `\"class_source\"` field.\n   - **Handling `(simpl)` in `class_source` Formatting:**\n      - If the extracted **sutta reference number** contains **\"(simpl)\"**, preserve it (e.g., `\"DN 19.7 (simpl)\"`).\n      - If **\"(simpl)\"** is **not present**, return only the core sutta number (e.g., `\"DN 19.7\"`).\n\n2. **Ensure Correct Sutta Reference Name Retrieval:**\n   - The **sutta reference name** (also known as the **sutta reference name**) will not be available in the exercise dataset.\n   - After obtaining the **sutta reference number**, retrieve the corresponding **sutta reference name**.\n      - Example: If **sutta reference number** is `\"AN 2.1\"`, the **sutta reference name** should be `\"vajjasutta\u1e43\"`.\n      - If the correct **sutta reference name** cannot be determined, return `\"unknown\"` instead of making an incorrect guess.\n   - Store the **sutta reference name** in the `\"class_sutta\"` field.\n\n3. **Formatting Rule for `\"class_example\"`:**\n   - The **selected Pali word** is **highlighted alone** within `<b>...</b>`.\n   - The capitalization of the entire sentence must remain exactly as in the exercise dataset.\n\n4. **`\"pali\"` Field Rule:**  \n   - The `\"pali\"` field **must always** match the **exact given Pali word**, including numbering if present (e.g., `\"anussarati 1.1\"`).\n   - Even if the extracted sentence contains a different **morphological form**, the `\"pali\"` field must **not** be altered.\n\n5. **`\"explanation\"` Field Rule:**  \n   - The `\"explanation\"` field should provide a brief justification for why the response was generated **if the user asks a question**.\n   - If the user requests a solution, provide a practical suggestion to achieve the desired outcome.\n   - If **no question is provided**, return an **empty string** (`\"\"`).\n\n6. **Output Structure and Formatting:**\n   - If a valid sentence is found and the sutta reference number is explicitly present within it, return the output in **JSON format** with the following structure:\n      {\n         \"id\": \"<Given Pali ID>\",\n         \"pali\": \"<Given Pali word>\",\n         \"selected_pali_word\": \"<Selected Pali word>\",\n         \"class_source\": \"<Sutta Reference Number>\",\n         \"class_sutta\": \"<Sutta Reference Name>\",\n         \"class_example\": \"<A full sentence with <b>Selected Pali word</b> highlighted, preserving original capitalization>\",\n         \"english_translation\": \"<English translation>\",\n         \"explanation\": \"<A justification for why this response was generated and a solution if applicable, or an empty string if no question was asked>\"\n      }\n   - If the sutta reference number is missing from the selected sentence, return an **empty JSON object** `{}`.\n   - If no valid sentence is found, return an **empty JSON object** `{}`.\n\n7. **Strict JSON Output rules:**\n   **IMPORTANT: FOLLOW THESE RULES STRICTLY**\n   - **DO NOT** wrap the JSON output in Markdown formatting (e.g., ` ```json ... ``` `).\n   - **DO NOT** add any extra text before or after the JSON response.\n   - **DO NOT** format the output as a code block.\n   - **ONLY RETURN A PLAIN JSON OBJECT.**\n   - **Failure to follow these rules will result in an invalid response.**\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "\n    For the given Pali word: \"gacchati 1\" with ID: \"24043\",     extract a relevant sentence in exercise data: \"Class 2 Exercises\n\nnamo tassa bhagavato arahato samm\u0101-sambuddhassa\t \t\t\t\t\t\nHomage to him, the Blessed One, the Worthy One, the fully Enlightened One.\n\u2003\navijj\u0101ya tv'eva asesa-vir\u0101ga-nirodh\u0101 sa\u1e45kh\u0101ra-nirodho, sa\u1e45kh\u0101ra-nirodh\u0101 vi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101\u1e47a-nirodho, vi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101\u1e47a-nirodh\u0101 n\u0101mar\u016bpa-nirodho, n\u0101mar\u016bpa-nirodh\u0101 sa\u1e37\u0101yatana-nirodho, sa\u1e37\u0101yatana-nirodh\u0101 phassa-nirodho, phassa-nirodh\u0101 vedan\u0101-nirodho, vedan\u0101-nirodh\u0101 ta\u1e47h\u0101-nirodho, ta\u1e47h\u0101-nirodh\u0101 up\u0101d\u0101na-nirodho, up\u0101d\u0101na-nirodh\u0101 bhava-nirodho, bhava-nirodh\u0101 j\u0101ti-nirodho, j\u0101ti-nirodh\u0101 jar\u0101-mara\u1e47a\u1e43 soka-parideva-dukkha-domanass'up\u0101y\u0101s\u0101 nirujjhanti. \nBut from the complete fading away and cessation of ignorance there is cessation of volitional formations;

Do **not** return single-word outputs (e.g., \"<b>Anussarati</b>\").\n   - A valid **sutta reference number** (also known as the **sutta number**) must be **explicitly present within the selected sentence**.\n   - **STRICT RULE**: \n      - If the **sutta reference number** (e.g., \"AN 3.71\") is **not found directly in the selected sentence itself**, **discard the selected sentence**.\n   - Remove any **sutta reference number** from the selected sentence (e.g., \"AN 3.71\", \"AN 3.71 (simpl)\", or similar citation formats) once identified.\n   - Store the **sutta reference number** in the `\"class_source\"` field.\n   - **Handling `(simpl)` in `class_source` Formatting:**\n      - If the extracted **sutta reference number** contains **\"(simpl)\"**, preserve it (e.g., `\"DN 19.7 (simpl)\"`).\n      - If **\"(simpl)\"** is **not present**, return only the core sutta number (e.g., `\"DN 19.7\"`).\n\n2. **Ensure Correct Sutta Reference Name Retrieval:**\n   - The **sutta reference name** (also known as the **sutta reference name**) will not be available in the exercise dataset.\n   - After obtaining the **sutta reference number**, retrieve the corresponding **sutta reference name**.\n      - Example: If **sutta reference number** is `\"AN 2.1\"`, the **sutta reference name** should be `\"vajjasutta\u1e43\"`.\n      - If the correct **sutta reference name** cannot be determined, return `\"unknown\"` instead of making an incorrect guess.\n   - Store the **sutta reference name** in the `\"class_sutta\"` field.\n\n3. **Formatting Rule for `\"class_example\"`:**\n   - The **selected Pali word** is **highlighted alone** within `<b>...</b>`.\n   - The capitalization of the entire sentence must remain exactly as in the exercise dataset.\n\n4. **`\"pali\"` Field Rule:**  \n   - The `\"pali\"` field **must always** match the **exact given Pali word**, including numbering if present (e.g., `\"anussarati 1.1\"`).\n   - Even if the extracted sentence contains a different **morphological form**, the `\"pali\"` field must **not** be altered.\n\n5. **`\"explanation\"` Field Rule:**  \n   - The `\"explanation\"` field should provide a brief justification for why the response was generated **if the user asks a question**.\n   - If the user requests a solution, provide a practical suggestion to achieve the desired outcome.\n   - If **no question is provided**, return an **empty string** (`\"\"`).\n\n6. **Output Structure and Formatting:**\n   - If a valid sentence is found and the sutta reference number is explicitly present within it, return the output in **JSON format** with the following structure:\n      {\n         \"id\": \"<Given Pali ID>\",\n         \"pali\": \"<Given Pali word>\",\n         \"selected_pali_word\": \"<Selected Pali word>\",\n         \"class_source\": \"<Sutta Reference Number>\",\n         \"class_sutta\": \"<Sutta Reference Name>\",\n         \"class_example\": \"<A full sentence with <b>Selected Pali word</b> highlighted, preserving original capitalization>\",\n         \"english_translation\": \"<English translation>\",\n         \"explanation\": \"<A justification for why this response was generated and a solution if applicable, or an empty string if no question was asked>\"\n      }\n   - If the sutta reference number is missing from the selected sentence, return an **empty JSON object** `{}`.\n   - If no valid sentence is found, return an **empty JSON object** `{}`.\n\n7. **Strict JSON Output rules:**\n   **IMPORTANT: FOLLOW THESE RULES STRICTLY**\n   - **DO NOT** wrap the JSON output in Markdown formatting (e.g., ` ```json ... ``` `).\n   - **DO NOT** add any extra text before or after the JSON response.\n   - **DO NOT** format the output as a code block.\n   - **ONLY RETURN A PLAIN JSON OBJECT.**\n   - **Failure to follow these rules will result in an invalid response.**\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "\n    For the given Pali word: \"gotama 1\" with ID: \"25265\",     extract a relevant sentence in exercise data: \"Class 2 Exercises\n\nnamo tassa bhagavato arahato samm\u0101-sambuddhassa\t \t\t\t\t\t\nHomage to him, the Blessed One, the Worthy One, the fully Enlightened One.\n\u2003\navijj\u0101ya tv'eva asesa-vir\u0101ga-nirodh\u0101 sa\u1e45kh\u0101ra-nirodho, sa\u1e45kh\u0101ra-nirodh\u0101 vi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101\u1e47a-nirodho, vi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101\u1e47a-nirodh\u0101 n\u0101mar\u016bpa-nirodho, n\u0101mar\u016bpa-nirodh\u0101 sa\u1e37\u0101yatana-nirodho, sa\u1e37\u0101yatana-nirodh\u0101 phassa-nirodho, phassa-nirodh\u0101 vedan\u0101-nirodho, vedan\u0101-nirodh\u0101 ta\u1e47h\u0101-nirodho, ta\u1e47h\u0101-nirodh\u0101 up\u0101d\u0101na-nirodho, up\u0101d\u0101na-nirodh\u0101 bhava-nirodho, bhava-nirodh\u0101 j\u0101ti-nirodho, j\u0101ti-nirodh\u0101 jar\u0101-mara\u1e47a\u1e43 soka-parideva-dukkha-domanass'up\u0101y\u0101s\u0101 nirujjhanti. \nBut from the complete fading away and cessation of ignorance there is cessation of volitional formations;

Do **not** return single-word outputs (e.g., \"<b>Anussarati</b>\").\n   - A valid **sutta reference number** (also known as the **sutta number**) must be **explicitly present within the selected sentence**.\n   - **STRICT RULE**: \n      - If the **sutta reference number** (e.g., \"AN 3.71\") is **not found directly in the selected sentence itself**, **discard the selected sentence**.\n   - Remove any **sutta reference number** from the selected sentence (e.g., \"AN 3.71\", \"AN 3.71 (simpl)\", or similar citation formats) once identified.\n   - Store the **sutta reference number** in the `\"class_source\"` field.\n   - **Handling `(simpl)` in `class_source` Formatting:**\n      - If the extracted **sutta reference number** contains **\"(simpl)\"**, preserve it (e.g., `\"DN 19.7 (simpl)\"`).\n      - If **\"(simpl)\"** is **not present**, return only the core sutta number (e.g., `\"DN 19.7\"`).\n\n2. **Ensure Correct Sutta Reference Name Retrieval:**\n   - The **sutta reference name** (also known as the **sutta reference name**) will not be available in the exercise dataset.\n   - After obtaining the **sutta reference number**, retrieve the corresponding **sutta reference name**.\n      - Example: If **sutta reference number** is `\"AN 2.1\"`, the **sutta reference name** should be `\"vajjasutta\u1e43\"`.\n      - If the correct **sutta reference name** cannot be determined, return `\"unknown\"` instead of making an incorrect guess.\n   - Store the **sutta reference name** in the `\"class_sutta\"` field.\n\n3. **Formatting Rule for `\"class_example\"`:**\n   - The **selected Pali word** is **highlighted alone** within `<b>...</b>`.\n   - The capitalization of the entire sentence must remain exactly as in the exercise dataset.\n\n4. **`\"pali\"` Field Rule:**  \n   - The `\"pali\"` field **must always** match the **exact given Pali word**, including numbering if present (e.g., `\"anussarati 1.1\"`).\n   - Even if the extracted sentence contains a different **morphological form**, the `\"pali\"` field must **not** be altered.\n\n5. **`\"explanation\"` Field Rule:**  \n   - The `\"explanation\"` field should provide a brief justification for why the response was generated **if the user asks a question**.\n   - If the user requests a solution, provide a practical suggestion to achieve the desired outcome.\n   - If **no question is provided**, return an **empty string** (`\"\"`).\n\n6. **Output Structure and Formatting:**\n   - If a valid sentence is found and the sutta reference number is explicitly present within it, return the output in **JSON format** with the following structure:\n      {\n         \"id\": \"<Given Pali ID>\",\n         \"pali\": \"<Given Pali word>\",\n         \"selected_pali_word\": \"<Selected Pali word>\",\n         \"class_source\": \"<Sutta Reference Number>\",\n         \"class_sutta\": \"<Sutta Reference Name>\",\n         \"class_example\": \"<A full sentence with <b>Selected Pali word</b> highlighted, preserving original capitalization>\",\n         \"english_translation\": \"<English translation>\",\n         \"explanation\": \"<A justification for why this response was generated and a solution if applicable, or an empty string if no question was asked>\"\n      }\n   - If the sutta reference number is missing from the selected sentence, return an **empty JSON object** `{}`.\n   - If no valid sentence is found, return an **empty JSON object** `{}`.\n\n7. **Strict JSON Output rules:**\n   **IMPORTANT: FOLLOW THESE RULES STRICTLY**\n   - **DO NOT** wrap the JSON output in Markdown formatting (e.g., ` ```json ... ``` `).\n   - **DO NOT** add any extra text before or after the JSON response.\n   - **DO NOT** format the output as a code block.\n   - **ONLY RETURN A PLAIN JSON OBJECT.**\n   - **Failure to follow these rules will result in an invalid response.**\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "\n    For the given Pali word: \"c\u012bvara 1\" with ID: \"26826\",     extract a relevant sentence in exercise data: \"Class 2 Exercises\n\nnamo tassa bhagavato arahato samm\u0101-sambuddhassa\t \t\t\t\t\t\nHomage to him, the Blessed One, the Worthy One, the fully Enlightened One.\n\u2003\navijj\u0101ya tv'eva asesa-vir\u0101ga-nirodh\u0101 sa\u1e45kh\u0101ra-nirodho, sa\u1e45kh\u0101ra-nirodh\u0101 vi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101\u1e47a-nirodho, vi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101\u1e47a-nirodh\u0101 n\u0101mar\u016bpa-nirodho, n\u0101mar\u016bpa-nirodh\u0101 sa\u1e37\u0101yatana-nirodho, sa\u1e37\u0101yatana-nirodh\u0101 phassa-nirodho, phassa-nirodh\u0101 vedan\u0101-nirodho, vedan\u0101-nirodh\u0101 ta\u1e47h\u0101-nirodho, ta\u1e47h\u0101-nirodh\u0101 up\u0101d\u0101na-nirodho, up\u0101d\u0101na-nirodh\u0101 bhava-nirodho, bhava-nirodh\u0101 j\u0101ti-nirodho, j\u0101ti-nirodh\u0101 jar\u0101-mara\u1e47a\u1e43 soka-parideva-dukkha-domanass'up\u0101y\u0101s\u0101 nirujjhanti. \nBut from the complete fading away and cessation of ignorance there is cessation of volitional formations;

Do **not** return single-word outputs (e.g., \"<b>Anussarati</b>\").\n   - A valid **sutta reference number** (also known as the **sutta number**) must be **explicitly present within the selected sentence**.\n   - **STRICT RULE**: \n      - If the **sutta reference number** (e.g., \"AN 3.71\") is **not found directly in the selected sentence itself**, **discard the selected sentence**.\n   - Remove any **sutta reference number** from the selected sentence (e.g., \"AN 3.71\", \"AN 3.71 (simpl)\", or similar citation formats) once identified.\n   - Store the **sutta reference number** in the `\"class_source\"` field.\n   - **Handling `(simpl)` in `class_source` Formatting:**\n      - If the extracted **sutta reference number** contains **\"(simpl)\"**, preserve it (e.g., `\"DN 19.7 (simpl)\"`).\n      - If **\"(simpl)\"** is **not present**, return only the core sutta number (e.g., `\"DN 19.7\"`).\n\n2. **Ensure Correct Sutta Reference Name Retrieval:**\n   - The **sutta reference name** (also known as the **sutta reference name**) will not be available in the exercise dataset.\n   - After obtaining the **sutta reference number**, retrieve the corresponding **sutta reference name**.\n      - Example: If **sutta reference number** is `\"AN 2.1\"`, the **sutta reference name** should be `\"vajjasutta\u1e43\"`.\n      - If the correct **sutta reference name** cannot be determined, return `\"unknown\"` instead of making an incorrect guess.\n   - Store the **sutta reference name** in the `\"class_sutta\"` field.\n\n3. **Formatting Rule for `\"class_example\"`:**\n   - The **selected Pali word** is **highlighted alone** within `<b>...</b>`.\n   - The capitalization of the entire sentence must remain exactly as in the exercise dataset.\n\n4. **`\"pali\"` Field Rule:**  \n   - The `\"pali\"` field **must always** match the **exact given Pali word**, including numbering if present (e.g., `\"anussarati 1.1\"`).\n   - Even if the extracted sentence contains a different **morphological form**, the `\"pali\"` field must **not** be altered.\n\n5. **`\"explanation\"` Field Rule:**  \n   - The `\"explanation\"` field should provide a brief justification for why the response was generated **if the user asks a question**.\n   - If the user requests a solution, provide a practical suggestion to achieve the desired outcome.\n   - If **no question is provided**, return an **empty string** (`\"\"`).\n\n6. **Output Structure and Formatting:**\n   - If a valid sentence is found and the sutta reference number is explicitly present within it, return the output in **JSON format** with the following structure:\n      {\n         \"id\": \"<Given Pali ID>\",\n         \"pali\": \"<Given Pali word>\",\n         \"selected_pali_word\": \"<Selected Pali word>\",\n         \"class_source\": \"<Sutta Reference Number>\",\n         \"class_sutta\": \"<Sutta Reference Name>\",\n         \"class_example\": \"<A full sentence with <b>Selected Pali word</b> highlighted, preserving original capitalization>\",\n         \"english_translation\": \"<English translation>\",\n         \"explanation\": \"<A justification for why this response was generated and a solution if applicable, or an empty string if no question was asked>\"\n      }\n   - If the sutta reference number is missing from the selected sentence, return an **empty JSON object** `{}`.\n   - If no valid sentence is found, return an **empty JSON object** `{}`.\n\n7. **Strict JSON Output rules:**\n   **IMPORTANT: FOLLOW THESE RULES STRICTLY**\n   - **DO NOT** wrap the JSON output in Markdown formatting (e.g., ` ```json ... ``` `).\n   - **DO NOT** add any extra text before or after the JSON response.\n   - **DO NOT** format the output as a code block.\n   - **ONLY RETURN A PLAIN JSON OBJECT.**\n   - **Failure to follow these rules will result in an invalid response.**\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "\n    For the given Pali word: \"\u00f1\u0101\u1e47adassana\" with ID: \"28861\",     extract a relevant sentence in exercise data: \"Class 2 Exercises\n\nnamo tassa bhagavato arahato samm\u0101-sambuddhassa\t \t\t\t\t\t\nHomage to him, the Blessed One, the Worthy One, the fully Enlightened One.\n\u2003\navijj\u0101ya tv'eva asesa-vir\u0101ga-nirodh\u0101 sa\u1e45kh\u0101ra-nirodho, sa\u1e45kh\u0101ra-nirodh\u0101 vi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101\u1e47a-nirodho, vi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101\u1e47a-nirodh\u0101 n\u0101mar\u016bpa-nirodho, n\u0101mar\u016bpa-nirodh\u0101 sa\u1e37\u0101yatana-nirodho, sa\u1e37\u0101yatana-nirodh\u0101 phassa-nirodho, phassa-nirodh\u0101 vedan\u0101-nirodho, vedan\u0101-nirodh\u0101 ta\u1e47h\u0101-nirodho, ta\u1e47h\u0101-nirodh\u0101 up\u0101d\u0101na-nirodho, up\u0101d\u0101na-nirodh\u0101 bhava-nirodho, bhava-nirodh\u0101 j\u0101ti-nirodho, j\u0101ti-nirodh\u0101 jar\u0101-mara\u1e47a\u1e43 soka-parideva-dukkha-domanass'up\u0101y\u0101s\u0101 nirujjhanti. \nBut from the complete fading away and cessation of ignorance there is cessation of volitional formations;

Do **not** return single-word outputs (e.g., \"<b>Anussarati</b>\").\n   - A valid **sutta reference number** (also known as the **sutta number**) must be **explicitly present within the selected sentence**.\n   - **STRICT RULE**: \n      - If the **sutta reference number** (e.g., \"AN 3.71\") is **not found directly in the selected sentence itself**, **discard the selected sentence**.\n   - Remove any **sutta reference number** from the selected sentence (e.g., \"AN 3.71\", \"AN 3.71 (simpl)\", or similar citation formats) once identified.\n   - Store the **sutta reference number** in the `\"class_source\"` field.\n   - **Handling `(simpl)` in `class_source` Formatting:**\n      - If the extracted **sutta reference number** contains **\"(simpl)\"**, preserve it (e.g., `\"DN 19.7 (simpl)\"`).\n      - If **\"(simpl)\"** is **not present**, return only the core sutta number (e.g., `\"DN 19.7\"`).\n\n2. **Ensure Correct Sutta Reference Name Retrieval:**\n   - The **sutta reference name** (also known as the **sutta reference name**) will not be available in the exercise dataset.\n   - After obtaining the **sutta reference number**, retrieve the corresponding **sutta reference name**.\n      - Example: If **sutta reference number** is `\"AN 2.1\"`, the **sutta reference name** should be `\"vajjasutta\u1e43\"`.\n      - If the correct **sutta reference name** cannot be determined, return `\"unknown\"` instead of making an incorrect guess.\n   - Store the **sutta reference name** in the `\"class_sutta\"` field.\n\n3. **Formatting Rule for `\"class_example\"`:**\n   - The **selected Pali word** is **highlighted alone** within `<b>...</b>`.\n   - The capitalization of the entire sentence must remain exactly as in the exercise dataset.\n\n4. **`\"pali\"` Field Rule:**  \n   - The `\"pali\"` field **must always** match the **exact given Pali word**, including numbering if present (e.g., `\"anussarati 1.1\"`).\n   - Even if the extracted sentence contains a different **morphological form**, the `\"pali\"` field must **not** be altered.\n\n5. **`\"explanation\"` Field Rule:**  \n   - The `\"explanation\"` field should provide a brief justification for why the response was generated **if the user asks a question**.\n   - If the user requests a solution, provide a practical suggestion to achieve the desired outcome.\n   - If **no question is provided**, return an **empty string** (`\"\"`).\n\n6. **Output Structure and Formatting:**\n   - If a valid sentence is found and the sutta reference number is explicitly present within it, return the output in **JSON format** with the following structure:\n      {\n         \"id\": \"<Given Pali ID>\",\n         \"pali\": \"<Given Pali word>\",\n         \"selected_pali_word\": \"<Selected Pali word>\",\n         \"class_source\": \"<Sutta Reference Number>\",\n         \"class_sutta\": \"<Sutta Reference Name>\",\n         \"class_example\": \"<A full sentence with <b>Selected Pali word</b> highlighted, preserving original capitalization>\",\n         \"english_translation\": \"<English translation>\",\n         \"explanation\": \"<A justification for why this response was generated and a solution if applicable, or an empty string if no question was asked>\"\n      }\n   - If the sutta reference number is missing from the selected sentence, return an **empty JSON object** `{}`.\n   - If no valid sentence is found, return an **empty JSON object** `{}`.\n\n7. **Strict JSON Output rules:**\n   **IMPORTANT: FOLLOW THESE RULES STRICTLY**\n   - **DO NOT** wrap the JSON output in Markdown formatting (e.g., ` ```json ... ``` `).\n   - **DO NOT** add any extra text before or after the JSON response.\n   - **DO NOT** format the output as a code block.\n   - **ONLY RETURN A PLAIN JSON OBJECT.**\n   - **Failure to follow these rules will result in an invalid response.**\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "\n    For the given Pali word: \"ta\u1e47h\u0101 1\" with ID: \"29346\",     extract a relevant sentence in exercise data: \"Class 2 Exercises\n\nnamo tassa bhagavato arahato samm\u0101-sambuddhassa\t \t\t\t\t\t\nHomage to him, the Blessed One, the Worthy One, the fully Enlightened One.\n\u2003\navijj\u0101ya tv'eva asesa-vir\u0101ga-nirodh\u0101 sa\u1e45kh\u0101ra-nirodho, sa\u1e45kh\u0101ra-nirodh\u0101 vi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101\u1e47a-nirodho, vi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101\u1e47a-nirodh\u0101 n\u0101mar\u016bpa-nirodho, n\u0101mar\u016bpa-nirodh\u0101 sa\u1e37\u0101yatana-nirodho, sa\u1e37\u0101yatana-nirodh\u0101 phassa-nirodho, phassa-nirodh\u0101 vedan\u0101-nirodho, vedan\u0101-nirodh\u0101 ta\u1e47h\u0101-nirodho, ta\u1e47h\u0101-nirodh\u0101 up\u0101d\u0101na-nirodho, up\u0101d\u0101na-nirodh\u0101 bhava-nirodho, bhava-nirodh\u0101 j\u0101ti-nirodho, j\u0101ti-nirodh\u0101 jar\u0101-mara\u1e47a\u1e43 soka-parideva-dukkha-domanass'up\u0101y\u0101s\u0101 nirujjhanti. \nBut from the complete fading away and cessation of ignorance there is cessation of volitional formations;

Do **not** return single-word outputs (e.g., \"<b>Anussarati</b>\").\n   - A valid **sutta reference number** (also known as the **sutta number**) must be **explicitly present within the selected sentence**.\n   - **STRICT RULE**: \n      - If the **sutta reference number** (e.g., \"AN 3.71\") is **not found directly in the selected sentence itself**, **discard the selected sentence**.\n   - Remove any **sutta reference number** from the selected sentence (e.g., \"AN 3.71\", \"AN 3.71 (simpl)\", or similar citation formats) once identified.\n   - Store the **sutta reference number** in the `\"class_source\"` field.\n   - **Handling `(simpl)` in `class_source` Formatting:**\n      - If the extracted **sutta reference number** contains **\"(simpl)\"**, preserve it (e.g., `\"DN 19.7 (simpl)\"`).\n      - If **\"(simpl)\"** is **not present**, return only the core sutta number (e.g., `\"DN 19.7\"`).\n\n2. **Ensure Correct Sutta Reference Name Retrieval:**\n   - The **sutta reference name** (also known as the **sutta reference name**) will not be available in the exercise dataset.\n   - After obtaining the **sutta reference number**, retrieve the corresponding **sutta reference name**.\n      - Example: If **sutta reference number** is `\"AN 2.1\"`, the **sutta reference name** should be `\"vajjasutta\u1e43\"`.\n      - If the correct **sutta reference name** cannot be determined, return `\"unknown\"` instead of making an incorrect guess.\n   - Store the **sutta reference name** in the `\"class_sutta\"` field.\n\n3. **Formatting Rule for `\"class_example\"`:**\n   - The **selected Pali word** is **highlighted alone** within `<b>...</b>`.\n   - The capitalization of the entire sentence must remain exactly as in the exercise dataset.\n\n4. **`\"pali\"` Field Rule:**  \n   - The `\"pali\"` field **must always** match the **exact given Pali word**, including numbering if present (e.g., `\"anussarati 1.1\"`).\n   - Even if the extracted sentence contains a different **morphological form**, the `\"pali\"` field must **not** be altered.\n\n5. **`\"explanation\"` Field Rule:**  \n   - The `\"explanation\"` field should provide a brief justification for why the response was generated **if the user asks a question**.\n   - If the user requests a solution, provide a practical suggestion to achieve the desired outcome.\n   - If **no question is provided**, return an **empty string** (`\"\"`).\n\n6. **Output Structure and Formatting:**\n   - If a valid sentence is found and the sutta reference number is explicitly present within it, return the output in **JSON format** with the following structure:\n      {\n         \"id\": \"<Given Pali ID>\",\n         \"pali\": \"<Given Pali word>\",\n         \"selected_pali_word\": \"<Selected Pali word>\",\n         \"class_source\": \"<Sutta Reference Number>\",\n         \"class_sutta\": \"<Sutta Reference Name>\",\n         \"class_example\": \"<A full sentence with <b>Selected Pali word</b> highlighted, preserving original capitalization>\",\n         \"english_translation\": \"<English translation>\",\n         \"explanation\": \"<A justification for why this response was generated and a solution if applicable, or an empty string if no question was asked>\"\n      }\n   - If the sutta reference number is missing from the selected sentence, return an **empty JSON object** `{}`.\n   - If no valid sentence is found, return an **empty JSON object** `{}`.\n\n7. **Strict JSON Output rules:**\n   **IMPORTANT: FOLLOW THESE RULES STRICTLY**\n   - **DO NOT** wrap the JSON output in Markdown formatting (e.g., ` ```json ... ``` `).\n   - **DO NOT** add any extra text before or after the JSON response.\n   - **DO NOT** format the output as a code block.\n   - **ONLY RETURN A PLAIN JSON OBJECT.**\n   - **Failure to follow these rules will result in an invalid response.**\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "\n    For the given Pali word: \"tveva 1\" with ID: \"31388\",     extract a relevant sentence in exercise data: \"Class 2 Exercises\n\nnamo tassa bhagavato arahato samm\u0101-sambuddhassa\t \t\t\t\t\t\nHomage to him, the Blessed One, the Worthy One, the fully Enlightened One.\n\u2003\navijj\u0101ya tv'eva asesa-vir\u0101ga-nirodh\u0101 sa\u1e45kh\u0101ra-nirodho, sa\u1e45kh\u0101ra-nirodh\u0101 vi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101\u1e47a-nirodho, vi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101\u1e47a-nirodh\u0101 n\u0101mar\u016bpa-nirodho, n\u0101mar\u016bpa-nirodh\u0101 sa\u1e37\u0101yatana-nirodho, sa\u1e37\u0101yatana-nirodh\u0101 phassa-nirodho, phassa-nirodh\u0101 vedan\u0101-nirodho, vedan\u0101-nirodh\u0101 ta\u1e47h\u0101-nirodho, ta\u1e47h\u0101-nirodh\u0101 up\u0101d\u0101na-nirodho, up\u0101d\u0101na-nirodh\u0101 bhava-nirodho, bhava-nirodh\u0101 j\u0101ti-nirodho, j\u0101ti-nirodh\u0101 jar\u0101-mara\u1e47a\u1e43 soka-parideva-dukkha-domanass'up\u0101y\u0101s\u0101 nirujjhanti. \nBut from the complete fading away and cessation of ignorance there is cessation of volitional formations;

Do **not** return single-word outputs (e.g., \"<b>Anussarati</b>\").\n   - A valid **sutta reference number** (also known as the **sutta number**) must be **explicitly present within the selected sentence**.\n   - **STRICT RULE**: \n      - If the **sutta reference number** (e.g., \"AN 3.71\") is **not found directly in the selected sentence itself**, **discard the selected sentence**.\n   - Remove any **sutta reference number** from the selected sentence (e.g., \"AN 3.71\", \"AN 3.71 (simpl)\", or similar citation formats) once identified.\n   - Store the **sutta reference number** in the `\"class_source\"` field.\n   - **Handling `(simpl)` in `class_source` Formatting:**\n      - If the extracted **sutta reference number** contains **\"(simpl)\"**, preserve it (e.g., `\"DN 19.7 (simpl)\"`).\n      - If **\"(simpl)\"** is **not present**, return only the core sutta number (e.g., `\"DN 19.7\"`).\n\n2. **Ensure Correct Sutta Reference Name Retrieval:**\n   - The **sutta reference name** (also known as the **sutta reference name**) will not be available in the exercise dataset.\n   - After obtaining the **sutta reference number**, retrieve the corresponding **sutta reference name**.\n      - Example: If **sutta reference number** is `\"AN 2.1\"`, the **sutta reference name** should be `\"vajjasutta\u1e43\"`.\n      - If the correct **sutta reference name** cannot be determined, return `\"unknown\"` instead of making an incorrect guess.\n   - Store the **sutta reference name** in the `\"class_sutta\"` field.\n\n3. **Formatting Rule for `\"class_example\"`:**\n   - The **selected Pali word** is **highlighted alone** within `<b>...</b>`.\n   - The capitalization of the entire sentence must remain exactly as in the exercise dataset.\n\n4. **`\"pali\"` Field Rule:**  \n   - The `\"pali\"` field **must always** match the **exact given Pali word**, including numbering if present (e.g., `\"anussarati 1.1\"`).\n   - Even if the extracted sentence contains a different **morphological form**, the `\"pali\"` field must **not** be altered.\n\n5. **`\"explanation\"` Field Rule:**  \n   - The `\"explanation\"` field should provide a brief justification for why the response was generated **if the user asks a question**.\n   - If the user requests a solution, provide a practical suggestion to achieve the desired outcome.\n   - If **no question is provided**, return an **empty string** (`\"\"`).\n\n6. **Output Structure and Formatting:**\n   - If a valid sentence is found and the sutta reference number is explicitly present within it, return the output in **JSON format** with the following structure:\n      {\n         \"id\": \"<Given Pali ID>\",\n         \"pali\": \"<Given Pali word>\",\n         \"selected_pali_word\": \"<Selected Pali word>\",\n         \"class_source\": \"<Sutta Reference Number>\",\n         \"class_sutta\": \"<Sutta Reference Name>\",\n         \"class_example\": \"<A full sentence with <b>Selected Pali word</b> highlighted, preserving original capitalization>\",\n         \"english_translation\": \"<English translation>\",\n         \"explanation\": \"<A justification for why this response was generated and a solution if applicable, or an empty string if no question was asked>\"\n      }\n   - If the sutta reference number is missing from the selected sentence, return an **empty JSON object** `{}`.\n   - If no valid sentence is found, return an **empty JSON object** `{}`.\n\n7. **Strict JSON Output rules:**\n   **IMPORTANT: FOLLOW THESE RULES STRICTLY**\n   - **DO NOT** wrap the JSON output in Markdown formatting (e.g., ` ```json ... ``` `).\n   - **DO NOT** add any extra text before or after the JSON response.\n   - **DO NOT** format the output as a code block.\n   - **ONLY RETURN A PLAIN JSON OBJECT.**\n   - **Failure to follow these rules will result in an invalid response.**\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "\n    For the given Pali word: \"dukkha 3\" with ID: \"32877\",     extract a relevant sentence in exercise data: \"Class 2 Exercises\n\nnamo tassa bhagavato arahato samm\u0101-sambuddhassa\t \t\t\t\t\t\nHomage to him, the Blessed One, the Worthy One, the fully Enlightened One.\n\u2003\navijj\u0101ya tv'eva asesa-vir\u0101ga-nirodh\u0101 sa\u1e45kh\u0101ra-nirodho, sa\u1e45kh\u0101ra-nirodh\u0101 vi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101\u1e47a-nirodho, vi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101\u1e47a-nirodh\u0101 n\u0101mar\u016bpa-nirodho, n\u0101mar\u016bpa-nirodh\u0101 sa\u1e37\u0101yatana-nirodho, sa\u1e37\u0101yatana-nirodh\u0101 phassa-nirodho, phassa-nirodh\u0101 vedan\u0101-nirodho, vedan\u0101-nirodh\u0101 ta\u1e47h\u0101-nirodho, ta\u1e47h\u0101-nirodh\u0101 up\u0101d\u0101na-nirodho, up\u0101d\u0101na-nirodh\u0101 bhava-nirodho, bhava-nirodh\u0101 j\u0101ti-nirodho, j\u0101ti-nirodh\u0101 jar\u0101-mara\u1e47a\u1e43 soka-parideva-dukkha-domanass'up\u0101y\u0101s\u0101 nirujjhanti. \nBut from the complete fading away and cessation of ignorance there is cessation of volitional formations;

Do **not** return single-word outputs (e.g., \"<b>Anussarati</b>\").\n   - A valid **sutta reference number** (also known as the **sutta number**) must be **explicitly present within the selected sentence**.\n   - **STRICT RULE**: \n      - If the **sutta reference number** (e.g., \"AN 3.71\") is **not found directly in the selected sentence itself**, **discard the selected sentence**.\n   - Remove any **sutta reference number** from the selected sentence (e.g., \"AN 3.71\", \"AN 3.71 (simpl)\", or similar citation formats) once identified.\n   - Store the **sutta reference number** in the `\"class_source\"` field.\n   - **Handling `(simpl)` in `class_source` Formatting:**\n      - If the extracted **sutta reference number** contains **\"(simpl)\"**, preserve it (e.g., `\"DN 19.7 (simpl)\"`).\n      - If **\"(simpl)\"** is **not present**, return only the core sutta number (e.g., `\"DN 19.7\"`).\n\n2. **Ensure Correct Sutta Reference Name Retrieval:**\n   - The **sutta reference name** (also known as the **sutta reference name**) will not be available in the exercise dataset.\n   - After obtaining the **sutta reference number**, retrieve the corresponding **sutta reference name**.\n      - Example: If **sutta reference number** is `\"AN 2.1\"`, the **sutta reference name** should be `\"vajjasutta\u1e43\"`.\n      - If the correct **sutta reference name** cannot be determined, return `\"unknown\"` instead of making an incorrect guess.\n   - Store the **sutta reference name** in the `\"class_sutta\"` field.\n\n3. **Formatting Rule for `\"class_example\"`:**\n   - The **selected Pali word** is **highlighted alone** within `<b>...</b>`.\n   - The capitalization of the entire sentence must remain exactly as in the exercise dataset.\n\n4. **`\"pali\"` Field Rule:**  \n   - The `\"pali\"` field **must always** match the **exact given Pali word**, including numbering if present (e.g., `\"anussarati 1.1\"`).\n   - Even if the extracted sentence contains a different **morphological form**, the `\"pali\"` field must **not** be altered.\n\n5. **`\"explanation\"` Field Rule:**  \n   - The `\"explanation\"` field should provide a brief justification for why the response was generated **if the user asks a question**.\n   - If the user requests a solution, provide a practical suggestion to achieve the desired outcome.\n   - If **no question is provided**, return an **empty string** (`\"\"`).\n\n6. **Output Structure and Formatting:**\n   - If a valid sentence is found and the sutta reference number is explicitly present within it, return the output in **JSON format** with the following structure:\n      {\n         \"id\": \"<Given Pali ID>\",\n         \"pali\": \"<Given Pali word>\",\n         \"selected_pali_word\": \"<Selected Pali word>\",\n         \"class_source\": \"<Sutta Reference Number>\",\n         \"class_sutta\": \"<Sutta Reference Name>\",\n         \"class_example\": \"<A full sentence with <b>Selected Pali word</b> highlighted, preserving original capitalization>\",\n         \"english_translation\": \"<English translation>\",\n         \"explanation\": \"<A justification for why this response was generated and a solution if applicable, or an empty string if no question was asked>\"\n      }\n   - If the sutta reference number is missing from the selected sentence, return an **empty JSON object** `{}`.\n   - If no valid sentence is found, return an **empty JSON object** `{}`.\n\n7. **Strict JSON Output rules:**\n   **IMPORTANT: FOLLOW THESE RULES STRICTLY**\n   - **DO NOT** wrap the JSON output in Markdown formatting (e.g., ` ```json ... ``` `).\n   - **DO NOT** add any extra text before or after the JSON response.\n   - **DO NOT** format the output as a code block.\n   - **ONLY RETURN A PLAIN JSON OBJECT.**\n   - **Failure to follow these rules will result in an invalid response.**\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "\n    For the given Pali word: \"devamanuss\u0101\" with ID: \"34108\",     extract a relevant sentence in exercise data: \"Class 2 Exercises\n\nnamo tassa bhagavato arahato samm\u0101-sambuddhassa\t \t\t\t\t\t\nHomage to him, the Blessed One, the Worthy One, the fully Enlightened One.\n\u2003\navijj\u0101ya tv'eva asesa-vir\u0101ga-nirodh\u0101 sa\u1e45kh\u0101ra-nirodho, sa\u1e45kh\u0101ra-nirodh\u0101 vi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101\u1e47a-nirodho, vi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101\u1e47a-nirodh\u0101 n\u0101mar\u016bpa-nirodho, n\u0101mar\u016bpa-nirodh\u0101 sa\u1e37\u0101yatana-nirodho, sa\u1e37\u0101yatana-nirodh\u0101 phassa-nirodho, phassa-nirodh\u0101 vedan\u0101-nirodho, vedan\u0101-nirodh\u0101 ta\u1e47h\u0101-nirodho, ta\u1e47h\u0101-nirodh\u0101 up\u0101d\u0101na-nirodho, up\u0101d\u0101na-nirodh\u0101 bhava-nirodho, bhava-nirodh\u0101 j\u0101ti-nirodho, j\u0101ti-nirodh\u0101 jar\u0101-mara\u1e47a\u1e43 soka-parideva-dukkha-domanass'up\u0101y\u0101s\u0101 nirujjhanti. \nBut from the complete fading away and cessation of ignorance there is cessation of volitional formations;

Do **not** return single-word outputs (e.g., \"<b>Anussarati</b>\").\n   - A valid **sutta reference number** (also known as the **sutta number**) must be **explicitly present within the selected sentence**.\n   - **STRICT RULE**: \n      - If the **sutta reference number** (e.g., \"AN 3.71\") is **not found directly in the selected sentence itself**, **discard the selected sentence**.\n   - Remove any **sutta reference number** from the selected sentence (e.g., \"AN 3.71\", \"AN 3.71 (simpl)\", or similar citation formats) once identified.\n   - Store the **sutta reference number** in the `\"class_source\"` field.\n   - **Handling `(simpl)` in `class_source` Formatting:**\n      - If the extracted **sutta reference number** contains **\"(simpl)\"**, preserve it (e.g., `\"DN 19.7 (simpl)\"`).\n      - If **\"(simpl)\"** is **not present**, return only the core sutta number (e.g., `\"DN 19.7\"`).\n\n2. **Ensure Correct Sutta Reference Name Retrieval:**\n   - The **sutta reference name** (also known as the **sutta reference name**) will not be available in the exercise dataset.\n   - After obtaining the **sutta reference number**, retrieve the corresponding **sutta reference name**.\n      - Example: If **sutta reference number** is `\"AN 2.1\"`, the **sutta reference name** should be `\"vajjasutta\u1e43\"`.\n      - If the correct **sutta reference name** cannot be determined, return `\"unknown\"` instead of making an incorrect guess.\n   - Store the **sutta reference name** in the `\"class_sutta\"` field.\n\n3. **Formatting Rule for `\"class_example\"`:**\n   - The **selected Pali word** is **highlighted alone** within `<b>...</b>`.\n   - The capitalization of the entire sentence must remain exactly as in the exercise dataset.\n\n4. **`\"pali\"` Field Rule:**  \n   - The `\"pali\"` field **must always** match the **exact given Pali word**, including numbering if present (e.g., `\"anussarati 1.1\"`).\n   - Even if the extracted sentence contains a different **morphological form**, the `\"pali\"` field must **not** be altered.\n\n5. **`\"explanation\"` Field Rule:**  \n   - The `\"explanation\"` field should provide a brief justification for why the response was generated **if the user asks a question**.\n   - If the user requests a solution, provide a practical suggestion to achieve the desired outcome.\n   - If **no question is provided**, return an **empty string** (`\"\"`).\n\n6. **Output Structure and Formatting:**\n   - If a valid sentence is found and the sutta reference number is explicitly present within it, return the output in **JSON format** with the following structure:\n      {\n         \"id\": \"<Given Pali ID>\",\n         \"pali\": \"<Given Pali word>\",\n         \"selected_pali_word\": \"<Selected Pali word>\",\n         \"class_source\": \"<Sutta Reference Number>\",\n         \"class_sutta\": \"<Sutta Reference Name>\",\n         \"class_example\": \"<A full sentence with <b>Selected Pali word</b> highlighted, preserving original capitalization>\",\n         \"english_translation\": \"<English translation>\",\n         \"explanation\": \"<A justification for why this response was generated and a solution if applicable, or an empty string if no question was asked>\"\n      }\n   - If the sutta reference number is missing from the selected sentence, return an **empty JSON object** `{}`.\n   - If no valid sentence is found, return an **empty JSON object** `{}`.\n\n7. **Strict JSON Output rules:**\n   **IMPORTANT: FOLLOW THESE RULES STRICTLY**\n   - **DO NOT** wrap the JSON output in Markdown formatting (e.g., ` ```json ... ``` `).\n   - **DO NOT** add any extra text before or after the JSON response.\n   - **DO NOT** format the output as a code block.\n   - **ONLY RETURN A PLAIN JSON OBJECT.**\n   - **Failure to follow these rules will result in an invalid response.**\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "\n    For the given Pali word: \"dhamma 1.03\" with ID: \"34628\",     extract a relevant sentence in exercise data: \"Class 2 Exercises\n\nnamo tassa bhagavato arahato samm\u0101-sambuddhassa\t \t\t\t\t\t\nHomage to him, the Blessed One, the Worthy One, the fully Enlightened One.\n\u2003\navijj\u0101ya tv'eva asesa-vir\u0101ga-nirodh\u0101 sa\u1e45kh\u0101ra-nirodho, sa\u1e45kh\u0101ra-nirodh\u0101 vi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101\u1e47a-nirodho, vi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101\u1e47a-nirodh\u0101 n\u0101mar\u016bpa-nirodho, n\u0101mar\u016bpa-nirodh\u0101 sa\u1e37\u0101yatana-nirodho, sa\u1e37\u0101yatana-nirodh\u0101 phassa-nirodho, phassa-nirodh\u0101 vedan\u0101-nirodho, vedan\u0101-nirodh\u0101 ta\u1e47h\u0101-nirodho, ta\u1e47h\u0101-nirodh\u0101 up\u0101d\u0101na-nirodho, up\u0101d\u0101na-nirodh\u0101 bhava-nirodho, bhava-nirodh\u0101 j\u0101ti-nirodho, j\u0101ti-nirodh\u0101 jar\u0101-mara\u1e47a\u1e43 soka-parideva-dukkha-domanass'up\u0101y\u0101s\u0101 nirujjhanti. \nBut from the complete fading away and cessation of ignorance there is cessation of volitional formations;

Do **not** return single-word outputs (e.g., \"<b>Anussarati</b>\").\n   - A valid **sutta reference number** (also known as the **sutta number**) must be **explicitly present within the selected sentence**.\n   - **STRICT RULE**: \n      - If the **sutta reference number** (e.g., \"AN 3.71\") is **not found directly in the selected sentence itself**, **discard the selected sentence**.\n   - Remove any **sutta reference number** from the selected sentence (e.g., \"AN 3.71\", \"AN 3.71 (simpl)\", or similar citation formats) once identified.\n   - Store the **sutta reference number** in the `\"class_source\"` field.\n   - **Handling `(simpl)` in `class_source` Formatting:**\n      - If the extracted **sutta reference number** contains **\"(simpl)\"**, preserve it (e.g., `\"DN 19.7 (simpl)\"`).\n      - If **\"(simpl)\"** is **not present**, return only the core sutta number (e.g., `\"DN 19.7\"`).\n\n2. **Ensure Correct Sutta Reference Name Retrieval:**\n   - The **sutta reference name** (also known as the **sutta reference name**) will not be available in the exercise dataset.\n   - After obtaining the **sutta reference number**, retrieve the corresponding **sutta reference name**.\n      - Example: If **sutta reference number** is `\"AN 2.1\"`, the **sutta reference name** should be `\"vajjasutta\u1e43\"`.\n      - If the correct **sutta reference name** cannot be determined, return `\"unknown\"` instead of making an incorrect guess.\n   - Store the **sutta reference name** in the `\"class_sutta\"` field.\n\n3. **Formatting Rule for `\"class_example\"`:**\n   - The **selected Pali word** is **highlighted alone** within `<b>...</b>`.\n   - The capitalization of the entire sentence must remain exactly as in the exercise dataset.\n\n4. **`\"pali\"` Field Rule:**  \n   - The `\"pali\"` field **must always** match the **exact given Pali word**, including numbering if present (e.g., `\"anussarati 1.1\"`).\n   - Even if the extracted sentence contains a different **morphological form**, the `\"pali\"` field must **not** be altered.\n\n5. **`\"explanation\"` Field Rule:**  \n   - The `\"explanation\"` field should provide a brief justification for why the response was generated **if the user asks a question**.\n   - If the user requests a solution, provide a practical suggestion to achieve the desired outcome.\n   - If **no question is provided**, return an **empty string** (`\"\"`).\n\n6. **Output Structure and Formatting:**\n   - If a valid sentence is found and the sutta reference number is explicitly present within it, return the output in **JSON format** with the following structure:\n      {\n         \"id\": \"<Given Pali ID>\",\n         \"pali\": \"<Given Pali word>\",\n         \"selected_pali_word\": \"<Selected Pali word>\",\n         \"class_source\": \"<Sutta Reference Number>\",\n         \"class_sutta\": \"<Sutta Reference Name>\",\n         \"class_example\": \"<A full sentence with <b>Selected Pali word</b> highlighted, preserving original capitalization>\",\n         \"english_translation\": \"<English translation>\",\n         \"explanation\": \"<A justification for why this response was generated and a solution if applicable, or an empty string if no question was asked>\"\n      }\n   - If the sutta reference number is missing from the selected sentence, return an **empty JSON object** `{}`.\n   - If no valid sentence is found, return an **empty JSON object** `{}`.\n\n7. **Strict JSON Output rules:**\n   **IMPORTANT: FOLLOW THESE RULES STRICTLY**\n   - **DO NOT** wrap the JSON output in Markdown formatting (e.g., ` ```json ... ``` `).\n   - **DO NOT** add any extra text before or after the JSON response.\n   - **DO NOT** format the output as a code block.\n   - **ONLY RETURN A PLAIN JSON OBJECT.**\n   - **Failure to follow these rules will result in an invalid response.**\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "\n    For the given Pali word: \"namo\" with ID: \"35805\",     extract a relevant sentence in exercise data: \"Class 2 Exercises\n\nnamo tassa bhagavato arahato samm\u0101-sambuddhassa\t \t\t\t\t\t\nHomage to him, the Blessed One, the Worthy One, the fully Enlightened One.\n\u2003\navijj\u0101ya tv'eva asesa-vir\u0101ga-nirodh\u0101 sa\u1e45kh\u0101ra-nirodho, sa\u1e45kh\u0101ra-nirodh\u0101 vi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101\u1e47a-nirodho, vi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101\u1e47a-nirodh\u0101 n\u0101mar\u016bpa-nirodho, n\u0101mar\u016bpa-nirodh\u0101 sa\u1e37\u0101yatana-nirodho, sa\u1e37\u0101yatana-nirodh\u0101 phassa-nirodho, phassa-nirodh\u0101 vedan\u0101-nirodho, vedan\u0101-nirodh\u0101 ta\u1e47h\u0101-nirodho, ta\u1e47h\u0101-nirodh\u0101 up\u0101d\u0101na-nirodho, up\u0101d\u0101na-nirodh\u0101 bhava-nirodho, bhava-nirodh\u0101 j\u0101ti-nirodho, j\u0101ti-nirodh\u0101 jar\u0101-mara\u1e47a\u1e43 soka-parideva-dukkha-domanass'up\u0101y\u0101s\u0101 nirujjhanti. \nBut from the complete fading away and cessation of ignorance there is cessation of volitional formations;

Do **not** return single-word outputs (e.g., \"<b>Anussarati</b>\").\n   - A valid **sutta reference number** (also known as the **sutta number**) must be **explicitly present within the selected sentence**.\n   - **STRICT RULE**: \n      - If the **sutta reference number** (e.g., \"AN 3.71\") is **not found directly in the selected sentence itself**, **discard the selected sentence**.\n   - Remove any **sutta reference number** from the selected sentence (e.g., \"AN 3.71\", \"AN 3.71 (simpl)\", or similar citation formats) once identified.\n   - Store the **sutta reference number** in the `\"class_source\"` field.\n   - **Handling `(simpl)` in `class_source` Formatting:**\n      - If the extracted **sutta reference number** contains **\"(simpl)\"**, preserve it (e.g., `\"DN 19.7 (simpl)\"`).\n      - If **\"(simpl)\"** is **not present**, return only the core sutta number (e.g., `\"DN 19.7\"`).\n\n2. **Ensure Correct Sutta Reference Name Retrieval:**\n   - The **sutta reference name** (also known as the **sutta reference name**) will not be available in the exercise dataset.\n   - After obtaining the **sutta reference number**, retrieve the corresponding **sutta reference name**.\n      - Example: If **sutta reference number** is `\"AN 2.1\"`, the **sutta reference name** should be `\"vajjasutta\u1e43\"`.\n      - If the correct **sutta reference name** cannot be determined, return `\"unknown\"` instead of making an incorrect guess.\n   - Store the **sutta reference name** in the `\"class_sutta\"` field.\n\n3. **Formatting Rule for `\"class_example\"`:**\n   - The **selected Pali word** is **highlighted alone** within `<b>...</b>`.\n   - The capitalization of the entire sentence must remain exactly as in the exercise dataset.\n\n4. **`\"pali\"` Field Rule:**  \n   - The `\"pali\"` field **must always** match the **exact given Pali word**, including numbering if present (e.g., `\"anussarati 1.1\"`).\n   - Even if the extracted sentence contains a different **morphological form**, the `\"pali\"` field must **not** be altered.\n\n5. **`\"explanation\"` Field Rule:**  \n   - The `\"explanation\"` field should provide a brief justification for why the response was generated **if the user asks a question**.\n   - If the user requests a solution, provide a practical suggestion to achieve the desired outcome.\n   - If **no question is provided**, return an **empty string** (`\"\"`).\n\n6. **Output Structure and Formatting:**\n   - If a valid sentence is found and the sutta reference number is explicitly present within it, return the output in **JSON format** with the following structure:\n      {\n         \"id\": \"<Given Pali ID>\",\n         \"pali\": \"<Given Pali word>\",\n         \"selected_pali_word\": \"<Selected Pali word>\",\n         \"class_source\": \"<Sutta Reference Number>\",\n         \"class_sutta\": \"<Sutta Reference Name>\",\n         \"class_example\": \"<A full sentence with <b>Selected Pali word</b> highlighted, preserving original capitalization>\",\n         \"english_translation\": \"<English translation>\",\n         \"explanation\": \"<A justification for why this response was generated and a solution if applicable, or an empty string if no question was asked>\"\n      }\n   - If the sutta reference number is missing from the selected sentence, return an **empty JSON object** `{}`.\n   - If no valid sentence is found, return an **empty JSON object** `{}`.\n\n7. **Strict JSON Output rules:**\n   **IMPORTANT: FOLLOW THESE RULES STRICTLY**\n   - **DO NOT** wrap the JSON output in Markdown formatting (e.g., ` ```json ... ``` `).\n   - **DO NOT** add any extra text before or after the JSON response.\n   - **DO NOT** format the output as a code block.\n   - **ONLY RETURN A PLAIN JSON OBJECT.**\n   - **Failure to follow these rules will result in an invalid response.**\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "\n    For the given Pali word: \"niraya\" with ID: \"37999\",     extract a relevant sentence in exercise data: \"Class 2 Exercises\n\nnamo tassa bhagavato arahato samm\u0101-sambuddhassa\t \t\t\t\t\t\nHomage to him, the Blessed One, the Worthy One, the fully Enlightened One.\n\u2003\navijj\u0101ya tv'eva asesa-vir\u0101ga-nirodh\u0101 sa\u1e45kh\u0101ra-nirodho, sa\u1e45kh\u0101ra-nirodh\u0101 vi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101\u1e47a-nirodho, vi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101\u1e47a-nirodh\u0101 n\u0101mar\u016bpa-nirodho, n\u0101mar\u016bpa-nirodh\u0101 sa\u1e37\u0101yatana-nirodho, sa\u1e37\u0101yatana-nirodh\u0101 phassa-nirodho, phassa-nirodh\u0101 vedan\u0101-nirodho, vedan\u0101-nirodh\u0101 ta\u1e47h\u0101-nirodho, ta\u1e47h\u0101-nirodh\u0101 up\u0101d\u0101na-nirodho, up\u0101d\u0101na-nirodh\u0101 bhava-nirodho, bhava-nirodh\u0101 j\u0101ti-nirodho, j\u0101ti-nirodh\u0101 jar\u0101-mara\u1e47a\u1e43 soka-parideva-dukkha-domanass'up\u0101y\u0101s\u0101 nirujjhanti. \nBut from the complete fading away and cessation of ignorance there is cessation of volitional formations;

Do **not** return single-word outputs (e.g., \"<b>Anussarati</b>\").\n   - A valid **sutta reference number** (also known as the **sutta number**) must be **explicitly present within the selected sentence**.\n   - **STRICT RULE**: \n      - If the **sutta reference number** (e.g., \"AN 3.71\") is **not found directly in the selected sentence itself**, **discard the selected sentence**.\n   - Remove any **sutta reference number** from the selected sentence (e.g., \"AN 3.71\", \"AN 3.71 (simpl)\", or similar citation formats) once identified.\n   - Store the **sutta reference number** in the `\"class_source\"` field.\n   - **Handling `(simpl)` in `class_source` Formatting:**\n      - If the extracted **sutta reference number** contains **\"(simpl)\"**, preserve it (e.g., `\"DN 19.7 (simpl)\"`).\n      - If **\"(simpl)\"** is **not present**, return only the core sutta number (e.g., `\"DN 19.7\"`).\n\n2. **Ensure Correct Sutta Reference Name Retrieval:**\n   - The **sutta reference name** (also known as the **sutta reference name**) will not be available in the exercise dataset.\n   - After obtaining the **sutta reference number**, retrieve the corresponding **sutta reference name**.\n      - Example: If **sutta reference number** is `\"AN 2.1\"`, the **sutta reference name** should be `\"vajjasutta\u1e43\"`.\n      - If the correct **sutta reference name** cannot be determined, return `\"unknown\"` instead of making an incorrect guess.\n   - Store the **sutta reference name** in the `\"class_sutta\"` field.\n\n3. **Formatting Rule for `\"class_example\"`:**\n   - The **selected Pali word** is **highlighted alone** within `<b>...</b>`.\n   - The capitalization of the entire sentence must remain exactly as in the exercise dataset.\n\n4. **`\"pali\"` Field Rule:**  \n   - The `\"pali\"` field **must always** match the **exact given Pali word**, including numbering if present (e.g., `\"anussarati 1.1\"`).\n   - Even if the extracted sentence contains a different **morphological form**, the `\"pali\"` field must **not** be altered.\n\n5. **`\"explanation\"` Field Rule:**  \n   - The `\"explanation\"` field should provide a brief justification for why the response was generated **if the user asks a question**.\n   - If the user requests a solution, provide a practical suggestion to achieve the desired outcome.\n   - If **no question is provided**, return an **empty string** (`\"\"`).\n\n6. **Output Structure and Formatting:**\n   - If a valid sentence is found and the sutta reference number is explicitly present within it, return the output in **JSON format** with the following structure:\n      {\n         \"id\": \"<Given Pali ID>\",\n         \"pali\": \"<Given Pali word>\",\n         \"selected_pali_word\": \"<Selected Pali word>\",\n         \"class_source\": \"<Sutta Reference Number>\",\n         \"class_sutta\": \"<Sutta Reference Name>\",\n         \"class_example\": \"<A full sentence with <b>Selected Pali word</b> highlighted, preserving original capitalization>\",\n         \"english_translation\": \"<English translation>\",\n         \"explanation\": \"<A justification for why this response was generated and a solution if applicable, or an empty string if no question was asked>\"\n      }\n   - If the sutta reference number is missing from the selected sentence, return an **empty JSON object** `{}`.\n   - If no valid sentence is found, return an **empty JSON object** `{}`.\n\n7. **Strict JSON Output rules:**\n   **IMPORTANT: FOLLOW THESE RULES STRICTLY**\n   - **DO NOT** wrap the JSON output in Markdown formatting (e.g., ` ```json ... ``` `).\n   - **DO NOT** add any extra text before or after the JSON response.\n   - **DO NOT** format the output as a code block.\n   - **ONLY RETURN A PLAIN JSON OBJECT.**\n   - **Failure to follow these rules will result in an invalid response.**\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "\n    For the given Pali word: \"n\u012bvara\u1e47a 1\" with ID: \"38615\",     extract a relevant sentence in exercise data: \"Class 2 Exercises\n\nnamo tassa bhagavato arahato samm\u0101-sambuddhassa\t \t\t\t\t\t\nHomage to him, the Blessed One, the Worthy One, the fully Enlightened One.\n\u2003\navijj\u0101ya tv'eva asesa-vir\u0101ga-nirodh\u0101 sa\u1e45kh\u0101ra-nirodho, sa\u1e45kh\u0101ra-nirodh\u0101 vi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101\u1e47a-nirodho, vi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101\u1e47a-nirodh\u0101 n\u0101mar\u016bpa-nirodho, n\u0101mar\u016bpa-nirodh\u0101 sa\u1e37\u0101yatana-nirodho, sa\u1e37\u0101yatana-nirodh\u0101 phassa-nirodho, phassa-nirodh\u0101 vedan\u0101-nirodho, vedan\u0101-nirodh\u0101 ta\u1e47h\u0101-nirodho, ta\u1e47h\u0101-nirodh\u0101 up\u0101d\u0101na-nirodho, up\u0101d\u0101na-nirodh\u0101 bhava-nirodho, bhava-nirodh\u0101 j\u0101ti-nirodho, j\u0101ti-nirodh\u0101 jar\u0101-mara\u1e47a\u1e43 soka-parideva-dukkha-domanass'up\u0101y\u0101s\u0101 nirujjhanti. \nBut from the complete fading away and cessation of ignorance there is cessation of volitional formations;

Do **not** return single-word outputs (e.g., \"<b>Anussarati</b>\").\n   - A valid **sutta reference number** (also known as the **sutta number**) must be **explicitly present within the selected sentence**.\n   - **STRICT RULE**: \n      - If the **sutta reference number** (e.g., \"AN 3.71\") is **not found directly in the selected sentence itself**, **discard the selected sentence**.\n   - Remove any **sutta reference number** from the selected sentence (e.g., \"AN 3.71\", \"AN 3.71 (simpl)\", or similar citation formats) once identified.\n   - Store the **sutta reference number** in the `\"class_source\"` field.\n   - **Handling `(simpl)` in `class_source` Formatting:**\n      - If the extracted **sutta reference number** contains **\"(simpl)\"**, preserve it (e.g., `\"DN 19.7 (simpl)\"`).\n      - If **\"(simpl)\"** is **not present**, return only the core sutta number (e.g., `\"DN 19.7\"`).\n\n2. **Ensure Correct Sutta Reference Name Retrieval:**\n   - The **sutta reference name** (also known as the **sutta reference name**) will not be available in the exercise dataset.\n   - After obtaining the **sutta reference number**, retrieve the corresponding **sutta reference name**.\n      - Example: If **sutta reference number** is `\"AN 2.1\"`, the **sutta reference name** should be `\"vajjasutta\u1e43\"`.\n      - If the correct **sutta reference name** cannot be determined, return `\"unknown\"` instead of making an incorrect guess.\n   - Store the **sutta reference name** in the `\"class_sutta\"` field.\n\n3. **Formatting Rule for `\"class_example\"`:**\n   - The **selected Pali word** is **highlighted alone** within `<b>...</b>`.\n   - The capitalization of the entire sentence must remain exactly as in the exercise dataset.\n\n4. **`\"pali\"` Field Rule:**  \n   - The `\"pali\"` field **must always** match the **exact given Pali word**, including numbering if present (e.g., `\"anussarati 1.1\"`).\n   - Even if the extracted sentence contains a different **morphological form**, the `\"pali\"` field must **not** be altered.\n\n5. **`\"explanation\"` Field Rule:**  \n   - The `\"explanation\"` field should provide a brief justification for why the response was generated **if the user asks a question**.\n   - If the user requests a solution, provide a practical suggestion to achieve the desired outcome.\n   - If **no question is provided**, return an **empty string** (`\"\"`).\n\n6. **Output Structure and Formatting:**\n   - If a valid sentence is found and the sutta reference number is explicitly present within it, return the output in **JSON format** with the following structure:\n      {\n         \"id\": \"<Given Pali ID>\",\n         \"pali\": \"<Given Pali word>\",\n         \"selected_pali_word\": \"<Selected Pali word>\",\n         \"class_source\": \"<Sutta Reference Number>\",\n         \"class_sutta\": \"<Sutta Reference Name>\",\n         \"class_example\": \"<A full sentence with <b>Selected Pali word</b> highlighted, preserving original capitalization>\",\n         \"english_translation\": \"<English translation>\",\n         \"explanation\": \"<A justification for why this response was generated and a solution if applicable, or an empty string if no question was asked>\"\n      }\n   - If the sutta reference number is missing from the selected sentence, return an **empty JSON object** `{}`.\n   - If no valid sentence is found, return an **empty JSON object** `{}`.\n\n7. **Strict JSON Output rules:**\n   **IMPORTANT: FOLLOW THESE RULES STRICTLY**\n   - **DO NOT** wrap the JSON output in Markdown formatting (e.g., ` ```json ... ``` `).\n   - **DO NOT** add any extra text before or after the JSON response.\n   - **DO NOT** format the output as a code block.\n   - **ONLY RETURN A PLAIN JSON OBJECT.**\n   - **Failure to follow these rules will result in an invalid response.**\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "\n    For the given Pali word: \"patta 1.1\" with ID: \"41845\",     extract a relevant sentence in exercise data: \"Class 2 Exercises\n\nnamo tassa bhagavato arahato samm\u0101-sambuddhassa\t \t\t\t\t\t\nHomage to him, the Blessed One, the Worthy One, the fully Enlightened One.\n\u2003\navijj\u0101ya tv'eva asesa-vir\u0101ga-nirodh\u0101 sa\u1e45kh\u0101ra-nirodho, sa\u1e45kh\u0101ra-nirodh\u0101 vi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101\u1e47a-nirodho, vi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101\u1e47a-nirodh\u0101 n\u0101mar\u016bpa-nirodho, n\u0101mar\u016bpa-nirodh\u0101 sa\u1e37\u0101yatana-nirodho, sa\u1e37\u0101yatana-nirodh\u0101 phassa-nirodho, phassa-nirodh\u0101 vedan\u0101-nirodho, vedan\u0101-nirodh\u0101 ta\u1e47h\u0101-nirodho, ta\u1e47h\u0101-nirodh\u0101 up\u0101d\u0101na-nirodho, up\u0101d\u0101na-nirodh\u0101 bhava-nirodho, bhava-nirodh\u0101 j\u0101ti-nirodho, j\u0101ti-nirodh\u0101 jar\u0101-mara\u1e47a\u1e43 soka-parideva-dukkha-domanass'up\u0101y\u0101s\u0101 nirujjhanti. \nBut from the complete fading away and cessation of ignorance there is cessation of volitional formations;

Do **not** return single-word outputs (e.g., \"<b>Anussarati</b>\").\n   - A valid **sutta reference number** (also known as the **sutta number**) must be **explicitly present within the selected sentence**.\n   - **STRICT RULE**: \n      - If the **sutta reference number** (e.g., \"AN 3.71\") is **not found directly in the selected sentence itself**, **discard the selected sentence**.\n   - Remove any **sutta reference number** from the selected sentence (e.g., \"AN 3.71\", \"AN 3.71 (simpl)\", or similar citation formats) once identified.\n   - Store the **sutta reference number** in the `\"class_source\"` field.\n   - **Handling `(simpl)` in `class_source` Formatting:**\n      - If the extracted **sutta reference number** contains **\"(simpl)\"**, preserve it (e.g., `\"DN 19.7 (simpl)\"`).\n      - If **\"(simpl)\"** is **not present**, return only the core sutta number (e.g., `\"DN 19.7\"`).\n\n2. **Ensure Correct Sutta Reference Name Retrieval:**\n   - The **sutta reference name** (also known as the **sutta reference name**) will not be available in the exercise dataset.\n   - After obtaining the **sutta reference number**, retrieve the corresponding **sutta reference name**.\n      - Example: If **sutta reference number** is `\"AN 2.1\"`, the **sutta reference name** should be `\"vajjasutta\u1e43\"`.\n      - If the correct **sutta reference name** cannot be determined, return `\"unknown\"` instead of making an incorrect guess.\n   - Store the **sutta reference name** in the `\"class_sutta\"` field.\n\n3. **Formatting Rule for `\"class_example\"`:**\n   - The **selected Pali word** is **highlighted alone** within `<b>...</b>`.\n   - The capitalization of the entire sentence must remain exactly as in the exercise dataset.\n\n4. **`\"pali\"` Field Rule:**  \n   - The `\"pali\"` field **must always** match the **exact given Pali word**, including numbering if present (e.g., `\"anussarati 1.1\"`).\n   - Even if the extracted sentence contains a different **morphological form**, the `\"pali\"` field must **not** be altered.\n\n5. **`\"explanation\"` Field Rule:**  \n   - The `\"explanation\"` field should provide a brief justification for why the response was generated **if the user asks a question**.\n   - If the user requests a solution, provide a practical suggestion to achieve the desired outcome.\n   - If **no question is provided**, return an **empty string** (`\"\"`).\n\n6. **Output Structure and Formatting:**\n   - If a valid sentence is found and the sutta reference number is explicitly present within it, return the output in **JSON format** with the following structure:\n      {\n         \"id\": \"<Given Pali ID>\",\n         \"pali\": \"<Given Pali word>\",\n         \"selected_pali_word\": \"<Selected Pali word>\",\n         \"class_source\": \"<Sutta Reference Number>\",\n         \"class_sutta\": \"<Sutta Reference Name>\",\n         \"class_example\": \"<A full sentence with <b>Selected Pali word</b> highlighted, preserving original capitalization>\",\n         \"english_translation\": \"<English translation>\",\n         \"explanation\": \"<A justification for why this response was generated and a solution if applicable, or an empty string if no question was asked>\"\n      }\n   - If the sutta reference number is missing from the selected sentence, return an **empty JSON object** `{}`.\n   - If no valid sentence is found, return an **empty JSON object** `{}`.\n\n7. **Strict JSON Output rules:**\n   **IMPORTANT: FOLLOW THESE RULES STRICTLY**\n   - **DO NOT** wrap the JSON output in Markdown formatting (e.g., ` ```json ... ``` `).\n   - **DO NOT** add any extra text before or after the JSON response.\n   - **DO NOT** format the output as a code block.\n   - **ONLY RETURN A PLAIN JSON OBJECT.**\n   - **Failure to follow these rules will result in an invalid response.**\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "\n    For the given Pali word: \"p\u0101n\u012byath\u0101laka\" with ID: \"45566\",     extract a relevant sentence in exercise data: \"Class 2 Exercises\n\nnamo tassa bhagavato arahato samm\u0101-sambuddhassa\t \t\t\t\t\t\nHomage to him, the Blessed One, the Worthy One, the fully Enlightened One.\n\u2003\navijj\u0101ya tv'eva asesa-vir\u0101ga-nirodh\u0101 sa\u1e45kh\u0101ra-nirodho, sa\u1e45kh\u0101ra-nirodh\u0101 vi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101\u1e47a-nirodho, vi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101\u1e47a-nirodh\u0101 n\u0101mar\u016bpa-nirodho, n\u0101mar\u016bpa-nirodh\u0101 sa\u1e37\u0101yatana-nirodho, sa\u1e37\u0101yatana-nirodh\u0101 phassa-nirodho, phassa-nirodh\u0101 vedan\u0101-nirodho, vedan\u0101-nirodh\u0101 ta\u1e47h\u0101-nirodho, ta\u1e47h\u0101-nirodh\u0101 up\u0101d\u0101na-nirodho, up\u0101d\u0101na-nirodh\u0101 bhava-nirodho, bhava-nirodh\u0101 j\u0101ti-nirodho, j\u0101ti-nirodh\u0101 jar\u0101-mara\u1e47a\u1e43 soka-parideva-dukkha-domanass'up\u0101y\u0101s\u0101 nirujjhanti. \nBut from the complete fading away and cessation of ignorance there is cessation of volitional formations;

Do **not** return single-word outputs (e.g., \"<b>Anussarati</b>\").\n   - A valid **sutta reference number** (also known as the **sutta number**) must be **explicitly present within the selected sentence**.\n   - **STRICT RULE**: \n      - If the **sutta reference number** (e.g., \"AN 3.71\") is **not found directly in the selected sentence itself**, **discard the selected sentence**.\n   - Remove any **sutta reference number** from the selected sentence (e.g., \"AN 3.71\", \"AN 3.71 (simpl)\", or similar citation formats) once identified.\n   - Store the **sutta reference number** in the `\"class_source\"` field.\n   - **Handling `(simpl)` in `class_source` Formatting:**\n      - If the extracted **sutta reference number** contains **\"(simpl)\"**, preserve it (e.g., `\"DN 19.7 (simpl)\"`).\n      - If **\"(simpl)\"** is **not present**, return only the core sutta number (e.g., `\"DN 19.7\"`).\n\n2. **Ensure Correct Sutta Reference Name Retrieval:**\n   - The **sutta reference name** (also known as the **sutta reference name**) will not be available in the exercise dataset.\n   - After obtaining the **sutta reference number**, retrieve the corresponding **sutta reference name**.\n      - Example: If **sutta reference number** is `\"AN 2.1\"`, the **sutta reference name** should be `\"vajjasutta\u1e43\"`.\n      - If the correct **sutta reference name** cannot be determined, return `\"unknown\"` instead of making an incorrect guess.\n   - Store the **sutta reference name** in the `\"class_sutta\"` field.\n\n3. **Formatting Rule for `\"class_example\"`:**\n   - The **selected Pali word** is **highlighted alone** within `<b>...</b>`.\n   - The capitalization of the entire sentence must remain exactly as in the exercise dataset.\n\n4. **`\"pali\"` Field Rule:**  \n   - The `\"pali\"` field **must always** match the **exact given Pali word**, including numbering if present (e.g., `\"anussarati 1.1\"`).\n   - Even if the extracted sentence contains a different **morphological form**, the `\"pali\"` field must **not** be altered.\n\n5. **`\"explanation\"` Field Rule:**  \n   - The `\"explanation\"` field should provide a brief justification for why the response was generated **if the user asks a question**.\n   - If the user requests a solution, provide a practical suggestion to achieve the desired outcome.\n   - If **no question is provided**, return an **empty string** (`\"\"`).\n\n6. **Output Structure and Formatting:**\n   - If a valid sentence is found and the sutta reference number is explicitly present within it, return the output in **JSON format** with the following structure:\n      {\n         \"id\": \"<Given Pali ID>\",\n         \"pali\": \"<Given Pali word>\",\n         \"selected_pali_word\": \"<Selected Pali word>\",\n         \"class_source\": \"<Sutta Reference Number>\",\n         \"class_sutta\": \"<Sutta Reference Name>\",\n         \"class_example\": \"<A full sentence with <b>Selected Pali word</b> highlighted, preserving original capitalization>\",\n         \"english_translation\": \"<English translation>\",\n         \"explanation\": \"<A justification for why this response was generated and a solution if applicable, or an empty string if no question was asked>\"\n      }\n   - If the sutta reference number is missing from the selected sentence, return an **empty JSON object** `{}`.\n   - If no valid sentence is found, return an **empty JSON object** `{}`.\n\n7. **Strict JSON Output rules:**\n   **IMPORTANT: FOLLOW THESE RULES STRICTLY**\n   - **DO NOT** wrap the JSON output in Markdown formatting (e.g., ` ```json ... ``` `).\n   - **DO NOT** add any extra text before or after the JSON response.\n   - **DO NOT** format the output as a code block.\n   - **ONLY RETURN A PLAIN JSON OBJECT.**\n   - **Failure to follow these rules will result in an invalid response.**\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "\n    For the given Pali word: \"b\u0101la 2\" with ID: \"48273\",     extract a relevant sentence in exercise data: \"Class 2 Exercises\n\nnamo tassa bhagavato arahato samm\u0101-sambuddhassa\t \t\t\t\t\t\nHomage to him, the Blessed One, the Worthy One, the fully Enlightened One.\n\u2003\navijj\u0101ya tv'eva asesa-vir\u0101ga-nirodh\u0101 sa\u1e45kh\u0101ra-nirodho, sa\u1e45kh\u0101ra-nirodh\u0101 vi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101\u1e47a-nirodho, vi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101\u1e47a-nirodh\u0101 n\u0101mar\u016bpa-nirodho, n\u0101mar\u016bpa-nirodh\u0101 sa\u1e37\u0101yatana-nirodho, sa\u1e37\u0101yatana-nirodh\u0101 phassa-nirodho, phassa-nirodh\u0101 vedan\u0101-nirodho, vedan\u0101-nirodh\u0101 ta\u1e47h\u0101-nirodho, ta\u1e47h\u0101-nirodh\u0101 up\u0101d\u0101na-nirodho, up\u0101d\u0101na-nirodh\u0101 bhava-nirodho, bhava-nirodh\u0101 j\u0101ti-nirodho, j\u0101ti-nirodh\u0101 jar\u0101-mara\u1e47a\u1e43 soka-parideva-dukkha-domanass'up\u0101y\u0101s\u0101 nirujjhanti. \nBut from the complete fading away and cessation of ignorance there is cessation of volitional formations;

Do **not** return single-word outputs (e.g., \"<b>Anussarati</b>\").\n   - A valid **sutta reference number** (also known as the **sutta number**) must be **explicitly present within the selected sentence**.\n   - **STRICT RULE**: \n      - If the **sutta reference number** (e.g., \"AN 3.71\") is **not found directly in the selected sentence itself**, **discard the selected sentence**.\n   - Remove any **sutta reference number** from the selected sentence (e.g., \"AN 3.71\", \"AN 3.71 (simpl)\", or similar citation formats) once identified.\n   - Store the **sutta reference number** in the `\"class_source\"` field.\n   - **Handling `(simpl)` in `class_source` Formatting:**\n      - If the extracted **sutta reference number** contains **\"(simpl)\"**, preserve it (e.g., `\"DN 19.7 (simpl)\"`).\n      - If **\"(simpl)\"** is **not present**, return only the core sutta number (e.g., `\"DN 19.7\"`).\n\n2. **Ensure Correct Sutta Reference Name Retrieval:**\n   - The **sutta reference name** (also known as the **sutta reference name**) will not be available in the exercise dataset.\n   - After obtaining the **sutta reference number**, retrieve the corresponding **sutta reference name**.\n      - Example: If **sutta reference number** is `\"AN 2.1\"`, the **sutta reference name** should be `\"vajjasutta\u1e43\"`.\n      - If the correct **sutta reference name** cannot be determined, return `\"unknown\"` instead of making an incorrect guess.\n   - Store the **sutta reference name** in the `\"class_sutta\"` field.\n\n3. **Formatting Rule for `\"class_example\"`:**\n   - The **selected Pali word** is **highlighted alone** within `<b>...</b>`.\n   - The capitalization of the entire sentence must remain exactly as in the exercise dataset.\n\n4. **`\"pali\"` Field Rule:**  \n   - The `\"pali\"` field **must always** match the **exact given Pali word**, including numbering if present (e.g., `\"anussarati 1.1\"`).\n   - Even if the extracted sentence contains a different **morphological form**, the `\"pali\"` field must **not** be altered.\n\n5. **`\"explanation\"` Field Rule:**  \n   - The `\"explanation\"` field should provide a brief justification for why the response was generated **if the user asks a question**.\n   - If the user requests a solution, provide a practical suggestion to achieve the desired outcome.\n   - If **no question is provided**, return an **empty string** (`\"\"`).\n\n6. **Output Structure and Formatting:**\n   - If a valid sentence is found and the sutta reference number is explicitly present within it, return the output in **JSON format** with the following structure:\n      {\n         \"id\": \"<Given Pali ID>\",\n         \"pali\": \"<Given Pali word>\",\n         \"selected_pali_word\": \"<Selected Pali word>\",\n         \"class_source\": \"<Sutta Reference Number>\",\n         \"class_sutta\": \"<Sutta Reference Name>\",\n         \"class_example\": \"<A full sentence with <b>Selected Pali word</b> highlighted, preserving original capitalization>\",\n         \"english_translation\": \"<English translation>\",\n         \"explanation\": \"<A justification for why this response was generated and a solution if applicable, or an empty string if no question was asked>\"\n      }\n   - If the sutta reference number is missing from the selected sentence, return an **empty JSON object** `{}`.\n   - If no valid sentence is found, return an **empty JSON object** `{}`.\n\n7. **Strict JSON Output rules:**\n   **IMPORTANT: FOLLOW THESE RULES STRICTLY**\n   - **DO NOT** wrap the JSON output in Markdown formatting (e.g., ` ```json ... ``` `).\n   - **DO NOT** add any extra text before or after the JSON response.\n   - **DO NOT** format the output as a code block.\n   - **ONLY RETURN A PLAIN JSON OBJECT.**\n   - **Failure to follow these rules will result in an invalid response.**\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "\n    For the given Pali word: \"br\u0101hma\u1e47a 2\" with ID: \"49034\",     extract a relevant sentence in exercise data: \"Class 2 Exercises\n\nnamo tassa bhagavato arahato samm\u0101-sambuddhassa\t \t\t\t\t\t\nHomage to him, the Blessed One, the Worthy One, the fully Enlightened One.\n\u2003\navijj\u0101ya tv'eva asesa-vir\u0101ga-nirodh\u0101 sa\u1e45kh\u0101ra-nirodho, sa\u1e45kh\u0101ra-nirodh\u0101 vi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101\u1e47a-nirodho, vi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101\u1e47a-nirodh\u0101 n\u0101mar\u016bpa-nirodho, n\u0101mar\u016bpa-nirodh\u0101 sa\u1e37\u0101yatana-nirodho, sa\u1e37\u0101yatana-nirodh\u0101 phassa-nirodho, phassa-nirodh\u0101 vedan\u0101-nirodho, vedan\u0101-nirodh\u0101 ta\u1e47h\u0101-nirodho, ta\u1e47h\u0101-nirodh\u0101 up\u0101d\u0101na-nirodho, up\u0101d\u0101na-nirodh\u0101 bhava-nirodho, bhava-nirodh\u0101 j\u0101ti-nirodho, j\u0101ti-nirodh\u0101 jar\u0101-mara\u1e47a\u1e43 soka-parideva-dukkha-domanass'up\u0101y\u0101s\u0101 nirujjhanti. \nBut from the complete fading away and cessation of ignorance there is cessation of volitional formations;

Do **not** return single-word outputs (e.g., \"<b>Anussarati</b>\").\n   - A valid **sutta reference number** (also known as the **sutta number**) must be **explicitly present within the selected sentence**.\n   - **STRICT RULE**: \n      - If the **sutta reference number** (e.g., \"AN 3.71\") is **not found directly in the selected sentence itself**, **discard the selected sentence**.\n   - Remove any **sutta reference number** from the selected sentence (e.g., \"AN 3.71\", \"AN 3.71 (simpl)\", or similar citation formats) once identified.\n   - Store the **sutta reference number** in the `\"class_source\"` field.\n   - **Handling `(simpl)` in `class_source` Formatting:**\n      - If the extracted **sutta reference number** contains **\"(simpl)\"**, preserve it (e.g., `\"DN 19.7 (simpl)\"`).\n      - If **\"(simpl)\"** is **not present**, return only the core sutta number (e.g., `\"DN 19.7\"`).\n\n2. **Ensure Correct Sutta Reference Name Retrieval:**\n   - The **sutta reference name** (also known as the **sutta reference name**) will not be available in the exercise dataset.\n   - After obtaining the **sutta reference number**, retrieve the corresponding **sutta reference name**.\n      - Example: If **sutta reference number** is `\"AN 2.1\"`, the **sutta reference name** should be `\"vajjasutta\u1e43\"`.\n      - If the correct **sutta reference name** cannot be determined, return `\"unknown\"` instead of making an incorrect guess.\n   - Store the **sutta reference name** in the `\"class_sutta\"` field.\n\n3. **Formatting Rule for `\"class_example\"`:**\n   - The **selected Pali word** is **highlighted alone** within `<b>...</b>`.\n   - The capitalization of the entire sentence must remain exactly as in the exercise dataset.\n\n4. **`\"pali\"` Field Rule:**  \n   - The `\"pali\"` field **must always** match the **exact given Pali word**, including numbering if present (e.g., `\"anussarati 1.1\"`).\n   - Even if the extracted sentence contains a different **morphological form**, the `\"pali\"` field must **not** be altered.\n\n5. **`\"explanation\"` Field Rule:**  \n   - The `\"explanation\"` field should provide a brief justification for why the response was generated **if the user asks a question**.\n   - If the user requests a solution, provide a practical suggestion to achieve the desired outcome.\n   - If **no question is provided**, return an **empty string** (`\"\"`).\n\n6. **Output Structure and Formatting:**\n   - If a valid sentence is found and the sutta reference number is explicitly present within it, return the output in **JSON format** with the following structure:\n      {\n         \"id\": \"<Given Pali ID>\",\n         \"pali\": \"<Given Pali word>\",\n         \"selected_pali_word\": \"<Selected Pali word>\",\n         \"class_source\": \"<Sutta Reference Number>\",\n         \"class_sutta\": \"<Sutta Reference Name>\",\n         \"class_example\": \"<A full sentence with <b>Selected Pali word</b> highlighted, preserving original capitalization>\",\n         \"english_translation\": \"<English translation>\",\n         \"explanation\": \"<A justification for why this response was generated and a solution if applicable, or an empty string if no question was asked>\"\n      }\n   - If the sutta reference number is missing from the selected sentence, return an **empty JSON object** `{}`.\n   - If no valid sentence is found, return an **empty JSON object** `{}`.\n\n7. **Strict JSON Output rules:**\n   **IMPORTANT: FOLLOW THESE RULES STRICTLY**\n   - **DO NOT** wrap the JSON output in Markdown formatting (e.g., ` ```json ... ``` `).\n   - **DO NOT** add any extra text before or after the JSON response.\n   - **DO NOT** format the output as a code block.\n   - **ONLY RETURN A PLAIN JSON OBJECT.**\n   - **Failure to follow these rules will result in an invalid response.**\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "\n    For the given Pali word: \"bhava 2\" with ID: \"49519\",     extract a relevant sentence in exercise data: \"Class 2 Exercises\n\nnamo tassa bhagavato arahato samm\u0101-sambuddhassa\t \t\t\t\t\t\nHomage to him, the Blessed One, the Worthy One, the fully Enlightened One.\n\u2003\navijj\u0101ya tv'eva asesa-vir\u0101ga-nirodh\u0101 sa\u1e45kh\u0101ra-nirodho, sa\u1e45kh\u0101ra-nirodh\u0101 vi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101\u1e47a-nirodho, vi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101\u1e47a-nirodh\u0101 n\u0101mar\u016bpa-nirodho, n\u0101mar\u016bpa-nirodh\u0101 sa\u1e37\u0101yatana-nirodho, sa\u1e37\u0101yatana-nirodh\u0101 phassa-nirodho, phassa-nirodh\u0101 vedan\u0101-nirodho, vedan\u0101-nirodh\u0101 ta\u1e47h\u0101-nirodho, ta\u1e47h\u0101-nirodh\u0101 up\u0101d\u0101na-nirodho, up\u0101d\u0101na-nirodh\u0101 bhava-nirodho, bhava-nirodh\u0101 j\u0101ti-nirodho, j\u0101ti-nirodh\u0101 jar\u0101-mara\u1e47a\u1e43 soka-parideva-dukkha-domanass'up\u0101y\u0101s\u0101 nirujjhanti. \nBut from the complete fading away and cessation of ignorance there is cessation of volitional formations;

Do **not** return single-word outputs (e.g., \"<b>Anussarati</b>\").\n   - A valid **sutta reference number** (also known as the **sutta number**) must be **explicitly present within the selected sentence**.\n   - **STRICT RULE**: \n      - If the **sutta reference number** (e.g., \"AN 3.71\") is **not found directly in the selected sentence itself**, **discard the selected sentence**.\n   - Remove any **sutta reference number** from the selected sentence (e.g., \"AN 3.71\", \"AN 3.71 (simpl)\", or similar citation formats) once identified.\n   - Store the **sutta reference number** in the `\"class_source\"` field.\n   - **Handling `(simpl)` in `class_source` Formatting:**\n      - If the extracted **sutta reference number** contains **\"(simpl)\"**, preserve it (e.g., `\"DN 19.7 (simpl)\"`).\n      - If **\"(simpl)\"** is **not present**, return only the core sutta number (e.g., `\"DN 19.7\"`).\n\n2. **Ensure Correct Sutta Reference Name Retrieval:**\n   - The **sutta reference name** (also known as the **sutta reference name**) will not be available in the exercise dataset.\n   - After obtaining the **sutta reference number**, retrieve the corresponding **sutta reference name**.\n      - Example: If **sutta reference number** is `\"AN 2.1\"`, the **sutta reference name** should be `\"vajjasutta\u1e43\"`.\n      - If the correct **sutta reference name** cannot be determined, return `\"unknown\"` instead of making an incorrect guess.\n   - Store the **sutta reference name** in the `\"class_sutta\"` field.\n\n3. **Formatting Rule for `\"class_example\"`:**\n   - The **selected Pali word** is **highlighted alone** within `<b>...</b>`.\n   - The capitalization of the entire sentence must remain exactly as in the exercise dataset.\n\n4. **`\"pali\"` Field Rule:**  \n   - The `\"pali\"` field **must always** match the **exact given Pali word**, including numbering if present (e.g., `\"anussarati 1.1\"`).\n   - Even if the extracted sentence contains a different **morphological form**, the `\"pali\"` field must **not** be altered.\n\n5. **`\"explanation\"` Field Rule:**  \n   - The `\"explanation\"` field should provide a brief justification for why the response was generated **if the user asks a question**.\n   - If the user requests a solution, provide a practical suggestion to achieve the desired outcome.\n   - If **no question is provided**, return an **empty string** (`\"\"`).\n\n6. **Output Structure and Formatting:**\n   - If a valid sentence is found and the sutta reference number is explicitly present within it, return the output in **JSON format** with the following structure:\n      {\n         \"id\": \"<Given Pali ID>\",\n         \"pali\": \"<Given Pali word>\",\n         \"selected_pali_word\": \"<Selected Pali word>\",\n         \"class_source\": \"<Sutta Reference Number>\",\n         \"class_sutta\": \"<Sutta Reference Name>\",\n         \"class_example\": \"<A full sentence with <b>Selected Pali word</b> highlighted, preserving original capitalization>\",\n         \"english_translation\": \"<English translation>\",\n         \"explanation\": \"<A justification for why this response was generated and a solution if applicable, or an empty string if no question was asked>\"\n      }\n   - If the sutta reference number is missing from the selected sentence, return an **empty JSON object** `{}`.\n   - If no valid sentence is found, return an **empty JSON object** `{}`.\n\n7. **Strict JSON Output rules:**\n   **IMPORTANT: FOLLOW THESE RULES STRICTLY**\n   - **DO NOT** wrap the JSON output in Markdown formatting (e.g., ` ```json ... ``` `).\n   - **DO NOT** add any extra text before or after the JSON response.\n   - **DO NOT** format the output as a code block.\n   - **ONLY RETURN A PLAIN JSON OBJECT.**\n   - **Failure to follow these rules will result in an invalid response.**\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "\n    For the given Pali word: \"manussadhamma 1\" with ID: \"51202\",     extract a relevant sentence in exercise data: \"Class 2 Exercises\n\nnamo tassa bhagavato arahato samm\u0101-sambuddhassa\t \t\t\t\t\t\nHomage to him, the Blessed One, the Worthy One, the fully Enlightened One.\n\u2003\navijj\u0101ya tv'eva asesa-vir\u0101ga-nirodh\u0101 sa\u1e45kh\u0101ra-nirodho, sa\u1e45kh\u0101ra-nirodh\u0101 vi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101\u1e47a-nirodho, vi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101\u1e47a-nirodh\u0101 n\u0101mar\u016bpa-nirodho, n\u0101mar\u016bpa-nirodh\u0101 sa\u1e37\u0101yatana-nirodho, sa\u1e37\u0101yatana-nirodh\u0101 phassa-nirodho, phassa-nirodh\u0101 vedan\u0101-nirodho, vedan\u0101-nirodh\u0101 ta\u1e47h\u0101-nirodho, ta\u1e47h\u0101-nirodh\u0101 up\u0101d\u0101na-nirodho, up\u0101d\u0101na-nirodh\u0101 bhava-nirodho, bhava-nirodh\u0101 j\u0101ti-nirodho, j\u0101ti-nirodh\u0101 jar\u0101-mara\u1e47a\u1e43 soka-parideva-dukkha-domanass'up\u0101y\u0101s\u0101 nirujjhanti. \nBut from the complete fading away and cessation of ignorance there is cessation of volitional formations;

Do **not** return single-word outputs (e.g., \"<b>Anussarati</b>\").\n   - A valid **sutta reference number** (also known as the **sutta number**) must be **explicitly present within the selected sentence**.\n   - **STRICT RULE**: \n      - If the **sutta reference number** (e.g., \"AN 3.71\") is **not found directly in the selected sentence itself**, **discard the selected sentence**.\n   - Remove any **sutta reference number** from the selected sentence (e.g., \"AN 3.71\", \"AN 3.71 (simpl)\", or similar citation formats) once identified.\n   - Store the **sutta reference number** in the `\"class_source\"` field.\n   - **Handling `(simpl)` in `class_source` Formatting:**\n      - If the extracted **sutta reference number** contains **\"(simpl)\"**, preserve it (e.g., `\"DN 19.7 (simpl)\"`).\n      - If **\"(simpl)\"** is **not present**, return only the core sutta number (e.g., `\"DN 19.7\"`).\n\n2. **Ensure Correct Sutta Reference Name Retrieval:**\n   - The **sutta reference name** (also known as the **sutta reference name**) will not be available in the exercise dataset.\n   - After obtaining the **sutta reference number**, retrieve the corresponding **sutta reference name**.\n      - Example: If **sutta reference number** is `\"AN 2.1\"`, the **sutta reference name** should be `\"vajjasutta\u1e43\"`.\n      - If the correct **sutta reference name** cannot be determined, return `\"unknown\"` instead of making an incorrect guess.\n   - Store the **sutta reference name** in the `\"class_sutta\"` field.\n\n3. **Formatting Rule for `\"class_example\"`:**\n   - The **selected Pali word** is **highlighted alone** within `<b>...</b>`.\n   - The capitalization of the entire sentence must remain exactly as in the exercise dataset.\n\n4. **`\"pali\"` Field Rule:**  \n   - The `\"pali\"` field **must always** match the **exact given Pali word**, including numbering if present (e.g., `\"anussarati 1.1\"`).\n   - Even if the extracted sentence contains a different **morphological form**, the `\"pali\"` field must **not** be altered.\n\n5. **`\"explanation\"` Field Rule:**  \n   - The `\"explanation\"` field should provide a brief justification for why the response was generated **if the user asks a question**.\n   - If the user requests a solution, provide a practical suggestion to achieve the desired outcome.\n   - If **no question is provided**, return an **empty string** (`\"\"`).\n\n6. **Output Structure and Formatting:**\n   - If a valid sentence is found and the sutta reference number is explicitly present within it, return the output in **JSON format** with the following structure:\n      {\n         \"id\": \"<Given Pali ID>\",\n         \"pali\": \"<Given Pali word>\",\n         \"selected_pali_word\": \"<Selected Pali word>\",\n         \"class_source\": \"<Sutta Reference Number>\",\n         \"class_sutta\": \"<Sutta Reference Name>\",\n         \"class_example\": \"<A full sentence with <b>Selected Pali word</b> highlighted, preserving original capitalization>\",\n         \"english_translation\": \"<English translation>\",\n         \"explanation\": \"<A justification for why this response was generated and a solution if applicable, or an empty string if no question was asked>\"\n      }\n   - If the sutta reference number is missing from the selected sentence, return an **empty JSON object** `{}`.\n   - If no valid sentence is found, return an **empty JSON object** `{}`.\n\n7. **Strict JSON Output rules:**\n   **IMPORTANT: FOLLOW THESE RULES STRICTLY**\n   - **DO NOT** wrap the JSON output in Markdown formatting (e.g., ` ```json ... ``` `).\n   - **DO NOT** add any extra text before or after the JSON response.\n   - **DO NOT** format the output as a code block.\n   - **ONLY RETURN A PLAIN JSON OBJECT.**\n   - **Failure to follow these rules will result in an invalid response.**\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "\n    For the given Pali word: \"m\u016bla 1\" with ID: \"53089\",     extract a relevant sentence in exercise data: \"Class 2 Exercises\n\nnamo tassa bhagavato arahato samm\u0101-sambuddhassa\t \t\t\t\t\t\nHomage to him, the Blessed One, the Worthy One, the fully Enlightened One.\n\u2003\navijj\u0101ya tv'eva asesa-vir\u0101ga-nirodh\u0101 sa\u1e45kh\u0101ra-nirodho, sa\u1e45kh\u0101ra-nirodh\u0101 vi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101\u1e47a-nirodho, vi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101\u1e47a-nirodh\u0101 n\u0101mar\u016bpa-nirodho, n\u0101mar\u016bpa-nirodh\u0101 sa\u1e37\u0101yatana-nirodho, sa\u1e37\u0101yatana-nirodh\u0101 phassa-nirodho, phassa-nirodh\u0101 vedan\u0101-nirodho, vedan\u0101-nirodh\u0101 ta\u1e47h\u0101-nirodho, ta\u1e47h\u0101-nirodh\u0101 up\u0101d\u0101na-nirodho, up\u0101d\u0101na-nirodh\u0101 bhava-nirodho, bhava-nirodh\u0101 j\u0101ti-nirodho, j\u0101ti-nirodh\u0101 jar\u0101-mara\u1e47a\u1e43 soka-parideva-dukkha-domanass'up\u0101y\u0101s\u0101 nirujjhanti. \nBut from the complete fading away and cessation of ignorance there is cessation of volitional formations;

Do **not** return single-word outputs (e.g., \"<b>Anussarati</b>\").\n   - A valid **sutta reference number** (also known as the **sutta number**) must be **explicitly present within the selected sentence**.\n   - **STRICT RULE**: \n      - If the **sutta reference number** (e.g., \"AN 3.71\") is **not found directly in the selected sentence itself**, **discard the selected sentence**.\n   - Remove any **sutta reference number** from the selected sentence (e.g., \"AN 3.71\", \"AN 3.71 (simpl)\", or similar citation formats) once identified.\n   - Store the **sutta reference number** in the `\"class_source\"` field.\n   - **Handling `(simpl)` in `class_source` Formatting:**\n      - If the extracted **sutta reference number** contains **\"(simpl)\"**, preserve it (e.g., `\"DN 19.7 (simpl)\"`).\n      - If **\"(simpl)\"** is **not present**, return only the core sutta number (e.g., `\"DN 19.7\"`).\n\n2. **Ensure Correct Sutta Reference Name Retrieval:**\n   - The **sutta reference name** (also known as the **sutta reference name**) will not be available in the exercise dataset.\n   - After obtaining the **sutta reference number**, retrieve the corresponding **sutta reference name**.\n      - Example: If **sutta reference number** is `\"AN 2.1\"`, the **sutta reference name** should be `\"vajjasutta\u1e43\"`.\n      - If the correct **sutta reference name** cannot be determined, return `\"unknown\"` instead of making an incorrect guess.\n   - Store the **sutta reference name** in the `\"class_sutta\"` field.\n\n3. **Formatting Rule for `\"class_example\"`:**\n   - The **selected Pali word** is **highlighted alone** within `<b>...</b>`.\n   - The capitalization of the entire sentence must remain exactly as in the exercise dataset.\n\n4. **`\"pali\"` Field Rule:**  \n   - The `\"pali\"` field **must always** match the **exact given Pali word**, including numbering if present (e.g., `\"anussarati 1.1\"`).\n   - Even if the extracted sentence contains a different **morphological form**, the `\"pali\"` field must **not** be altered.\n\n5. **`\"explanation\"` Field Rule:**  \n   - The `\"explanation\"` field should provide a brief justification for why the response was generated **if the user asks a question**.\n   - If the user requests a solution, provide a practical suggestion to achieve the desired outcome.\n   - If **no question is provided**, return an **empty string** (`\"\"`).\n\n6. **Output Structure and Formatting:**\n   - If a valid sentence is found and the sutta reference number is explicitly present within it, return the output in **JSON format** with the following structure:\n      {\n         \"id\": \"<Given Pali ID>\",\n         \"pali\": \"<Given Pali word>\",\n         \"selected_pali_word\": \"<Selected Pali word>\",\n         \"class_source\": \"<Sutta Reference Number>\",\n         \"class_sutta\": \"<Sutta Reference Name>\",\n         \"class_example\": \"<A full sentence with <b>Selected Pali word</b> highlighted, preserving original capitalization>\",\n         \"english_translation\": \"<English translation>\",\n         \"explanation\": \"<A justification for why this response was generated and a solution if applicable, or an empty string if no question was asked>\"\n      }\n   - If the sutta reference number is missing from the selected sentence, return an **empty JSON object** `{}`.\n   - If no valid sentence is found, return an **empty JSON object** `{}`.\n\n7. **Strict JSON Output rules:**\n   **IMPORTANT: FOLLOW THESE RULES STRICTLY**\n   - **DO NOT** wrap the JSON output in Markdown formatting (e.g., ` ```json ... ``` `).\n   - **DO NOT** add any extra text before or after the JSON response.\n   - **DO NOT** format the output as a code block.\n   - **ONLY RETURN A PLAIN JSON OBJECT.**\n   - **Failure to follow these rules will result in an invalid response.**\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "\n    For the given Pali word: \"loka 1\" with ID: \"55972\",     extract a relevant sentence in exercise data: \"Class 2 Exercises\n\nnamo tassa bhagavato arahato samm\u0101-sambuddhassa\t \t\t\t\t\t\nHomage to him, the Blessed One, the Worthy One, the fully Enlightened One.\n\u2003\navijj\u0101ya tv'eva asesa-vir\u0101ga-nirodh\u0101 sa\u1e45kh\u0101ra-nirodho, sa\u1e45kh\u0101ra-nirodh\u0101 vi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101\u1e47a-nirodho, vi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101\u1e47a-nirodh\u0101 n\u0101mar\u016bpa-nirodho, n\u0101mar\u016bpa-nirodh\u0101 sa\u1e37\u0101yatana-nirodho, sa\u1e37\u0101yatana-nirodh\u0101 phassa-nirodho, phassa-nirodh\u0101 vedan\u0101-nirodho, vedan\u0101-nirodh\u0101 ta\u1e47h\u0101-nirodho, ta\u1e47h\u0101-nirodh\u0101 up\u0101d\u0101na-nirodho, up\u0101d\u0101na-nirodh\u0101 bhava-nirodho, bhava-nirodh\u0101 j\u0101ti-nirodho, j\u0101ti-nirodh\u0101 jar\u0101-mara\u1e47a\u1e43 soka-parideva-dukkha-domanass'up\u0101y\u0101s\u0101 nirujjhanti. \nBut from the complete fading away and cessation of ignorance there is cessation of volitional formations;

Do **not** return single-word outputs (e.g., \"<b>Anussarati</b>\").\n   - A valid **sutta reference number** (also known as the **sutta number**) must be **explicitly present within the selected sentence**.\n   - **STRICT RULE**: \n      - If the **sutta reference number** (e.g., \"AN 3.71\") is **not found directly in the selected sentence itself**, **discard the selected sentence**.\n   - Remove any **sutta reference number** from the selected sentence (e.g., \"AN 3.71\", \"AN 3.71 (simpl)\", or similar citation formats) once identified.\n   - Store the **sutta reference number** in the `\"class_source\"` field.\n   - **Handling `(simpl)` in `class_source` Formatting:**\n      - If the extracted **sutta reference number** contains **\"(simpl)\"**, preserve it (e.g., `\"DN 19.7 (simpl)\"`).\n      - If **\"(simpl)\"** is **not present**, return only the core sutta number (e.g., `\"DN 19.7\"`).\n\n2. **Ensure Correct Sutta Reference Name Retrieval:**\n   - The **sutta reference name** (also known as the **sutta reference name**) will not be available in the exercise dataset.\n   - After obtaining the **sutta reference number**, retrieve the corresponding **sutta reference name**.\n      - Example: If **sutta reference number** is `\"AN 2.1\"`, the **sutta reference name** should be `\"vajjasutta\u1e43\"`.\n      - If the correct **sutta reference name** cannot be determined, return `\"unknown\"` instead of making an incorrect guess.\n   - Store the **sutta reference name** in the `\"class_sutta\"` field.\n\n3. **Formatting Rule for `\"class_example\"`:**\n   - The **selected Pali word** is **highlighted alone** within `<b>...</b>`.\n   - The capitalization of the entire sentence must remain exactly as in the exercise dataset.\n\n4. **`\"pali\"` Field Rule:**  \n   - The `\"pali\"` field **must always** match the **exact given Pali word**, including numbering if present (e.g., `\"anussarati 1.1\"`).\n   - Even if the extracted sentence contains a different **morphological form**, the `\"pali\"` field must **not** be altered.\n\n5. **`\"explanation\"` Field Rule:**  \n   - The `\"explanation\"` field should provide a brief justification for why the response was generated **if the user asks a question**.\n   - If the user requests a solution, provide a practical suggestion to achieve the desired outcome.\n   - If **no question is provided**, return an **empty string** (`\"\"`).\n\n6. **Output Structure and Formatting:**\n   - If a valid sentence is found and the sutta reference number is explicitly present within it, return the output in **JSON format** with the following structure:\n      {\n         \"id\": \"<Given Pali ID>\",\n         \"pali\": \"<Given Pali word>\",\n         \"selected_pali_word\": \"<Selected Pali word>\",\n         \"class_source\": \"<Sutta Reference Number>\",\n         \"class_sutta\": \"<Sutta Reference Name>\",\n         \"class_example\": \"<A full sentence with <b>Selected Pali word</b> highlighted, preserving original capitalization>\",\n         \"english_translation\": \"<English translation>\",\n         \"explanation\": \"<A justification for why this response was generated and a solution if applicable, or an empty string if no question was asked>\"\n      }\n   - If the sutta reference number is missing from the selected sentence, return an **empty JSON object** `{}`.\n   - If no valid sentence is found, return an **empty JSON object** `{}`.\n\n7. **Strict JSON Output rules:**\n   **IMPORTANT: FOLLOW THESE RULES STRICTLY**\n   - **DO NOT** wrap the JSON output in Markdown formatting (e.g., ` ```json ... ``` `).\n   - **DO NOT** add any extra text before or after the JSON response.\n   - **DO NOT** format the output as a code block.\n   - **ONLY RETURN A PLAIN JSON OBJECT.**\n   - **Failure to follow these rules will result in an invalid response.**\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "\n    For the given Pali word: \"sa\u1e45kh\u0101ra 1\" with ID: \"56768\",     extract a relevant sentence in exercise data: \"Class 2 Exercises\n\nnamo tassa bhagavato arahato samm\u0101-sambuddhassa\t \t\t\t\t\t\nHomage to him, the Blessed One, the Worthy One, the fully Enlightened One.\n\u2003\navijj\u0101ya tv'eva asesa-vir\u0101ga-nirodh\u0101 sa\u1e45kh\u0101ra-nirodho, sa\u1e45kh\u0101ra-nirodh\u0101 vi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101\u1e47a-nirodho, vi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101\u1e47a-nirodh\u0101 n\u0101mar\u016bpa-nirodho, n\u0101mar\u016bpa-nirodh\u0101 sa\u1e37\u0101yatana-nirodho, sa\u1e37\u0101yatana-nirodh\u0101 phassa-nirodho, phassa-nirodh\u0101 vedan\u0101-nirodho, vedan\u0101-nirodh\u0101 ta\u1e47h\u0101-nirodho, ta\u1e47h\u0101-nirodh\u0101 up\u0101d\u0101na-nirodho, up\u0101d\u0101na-nirodh\u0101 bhava-nirodho, bhava-nirodh\u0101 j\u0101ti-nirodho, j\u0101ti-nirodh\u0101 jar\u0101-mara\u1e47a\u1e43 soka-parideva-dukkha-domanass'up\u0101y\u0101s\u0101 nirujjhanti. \nBut from the complete fading away and cessation of ignorance there is cessation of volitional formations;

Do **not** return single-word outputs (e.g., \"<b>Anussarati</b>\").\n   - A valid **sutta reference number** (also known as the **sutta number**) must be **explicitly present within the selected sentence**.\n   - **STRICT RULE**: \n      - If the **sutta reference number** (e.g., \"AN 3.71\") is **not found directly in the selected sentence itself**, **discard the selected sentence**.\n   - Remove any **sutta reference number** from the selected sentence (e.g., \"AN 3.71\", \"AN 3.71 (simpl)\", or similar citation formats) once identified.\n   - Store the **sutta reference number** in the `\"class_source\"` field.\n   - **Handling `(simpl)` in `class_source` Formatting:**\n      - If the extracted **sutta reference number** contains **\"(simpl)\"**, preserve it (e.g., `\"DN 19.7 (simpl)\"`).\n      - If **\"(simpl)\"** is **not present**, return only the core sutta number (e.g., `\"DN 19.7\"`).\n\n2. **Ensure Correct Sutta Reference Name Retrieval:**\n   - The **sutta reference name** (also known as the **sutta reference name**) will not be available in the exercise dataset.\n   - After obtaining the **sutta reference number**, retrieve the corresponding **sutta reference name**.\n      - Example: If **sutta reference number** is `\"AN 2.1\"`, the **sutta reference name** should be `\"vajjasutta\u1e43\"`.\n      - If the correct **sutta reference name** cannot be determined, return `\"unknown\"` instead of making an incorrect guess.\n   - Store the **sutta reference name** in the `\"class_sutta\"` field.\n\n3. **Formatting Rule for `\"class_example\"`:**\n   - The **selected Pali word** is **highlighted alone** within `<b>...</b>`.\n   - The capitalization of the entire sentence must remain exactly as in the exercise dataset.\n\n4. **`\"pali\"` Field Rule:**  \n   - The `\"pali\"` field **must always** match the **exact given Pali word**, including numbering if present (e.g., `\"anussarati 1.1\"`).\n   - Even if the extracted sentence contains a different **morphological form**, the `\"pali\"` field must **not** be altered.\n\n5. **`\"explanation\"` Field Rule:**  \n   - The `\"explanation\"` field should provide a brief justification for why the response was generated **if the user asks a question**.\n   - If the user requests a solution, provide a practical suggestion to achieve the desired outcome.\n   - If **no question is provided**, return an **empty string** (`\"\"`).\n\n6. **Output Structure and Formatting:**\n   - If a valid sentence is found and the sutta reference number is explicitly present within it, return the output in **JSON format** with the following structure:\n      {\n         \"id\": \"<Given Pali ID>\",\n         \"pali\": \"<Given Pali word>\",\n         \"selected_pali_word\": \"<Selected Pali word>\",\n         \"class_source\": \"<Sutta Reference Number>\",\n         \"class_sutta\": \"<Sutta Reference Name>\",\n         \"class_example\": \"<A full sentence with <b>Selected Pali word</b> highlighted, preserving original capitalization>\",\n         \"english_translation\": \"<English translation>\",\n         \"explanation\": \"<A justification for why this response was generated and a solution if applicable, or an empty string if no question was asked>\"\n      }\n   - If the sutta reference number is missing from the selected sentence, return an **empty JSON object** `{}`.\n   - If no valid sentence is found, return an **empty JSON object** `{}`.\n\n7. **Strict JSON Output rules:**\n   **IMPORTANT: FOLLOW THESE RULES STRICTLY**\n   - **DO NOT** wrap the JSON output in Markdown formatting (e.g., ` ```json ... ``` `).\n   - **DO NOT** add any extra text before or after the JSON response.\n   - **DO NOT** format the output as a code block.\n   - **ONLY RETURN A PLAIN JSON OBJECT.**\n   - **Failure to follow these rules will result in an invalid response.**\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "\n    For the given Pali word: \"sacchikiriy\u0101\" with ID: \"57194\",     extract a relevant sentence in exercise data: \"Class 2 Exercises\n\nnamo tassa bhagavato arahato samm\u0101-sambuddhassa\t \t\t\t\t\t\nHomage to him, the Blessed One, the Worthy One, the fully Enlightened One.\n\u2003\navijj\u0101ya tv'eva asesa-vir\u0101ga-nirodh\u0101 sa\u1e45kh\u0101ra-nirodho, sa\u1e45kh\u0101ra-nirodh\u0101 vi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101\u1e47a-nirodho, vi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101\u1e47a-nirodh\u0101 n\u0101mar\u016bpa-nirodho, n\u0101mar\u016bpa-nirodh\u0101 sa\u1e37\u0101yatana-nirodho, sa\u1e37\u0101yatana-nirodh\u0101 phassa-nirodho, phassa-nirodh\u0101 vedan\u0101-nirodho, vedan\u0101-nirodh\u0101 ta\u1e47h\u0101-nirodho, ta\u1e47h\u0101-nirodh\u0101 up\u0101d\u0101na-nirodho, up\u0101d\u0101na-nirodh\u0101 bhava-nirodho, bhava-nirodh\u0101 j\u0101ti-nirodho, j\u0101ti-nirodh\u0101 jar\u0101-mara\u1e47a\u1e43 soka-parideva-dukkha-domanass'up\u0101y\u0101s\u0101 nirujjhanti. \nBut from the complete fading away and cessation of ignorance there is cessation of volitional formations;

Do **not** return single-word outputs (e.g., \"<b>Anussarati</b>\").\n   - A valid **sutta reference number** (also known as the **sutta number**) must be **explicitly present within the selected sentence**.\n   - **STRICT RULE**: \n      - If the **sutta reference number** (e.g., \"AN 3.71\") is **not found directly in the selected sentence itself**, **discard the selected sentence**.\n   - Remove any **sutta reference number** from the selected sentence (e.g., \"AN 3.71\", \"AN 3.71 (simpl)\", or similar citation formats) once identified.\n   - Store the **sutta reference number** in the `\"class_source\"` field.\n   - **Handling `(simpl)` in `class_source` Formatting:**\n      - If the extracted **sutta reference number** contains **\"(simpl)\"**, preserve it (e.g., `\"DN 19.7 (simpl)\"`).\n      - If **\"(simpl)\"** is **not present**, return only the core sutta number (e.g., `\"DN 19.7\"`).\n\n2. **Ensure Correct Sutta Reference Name Retrieval:**\n   - The **sutta reference name** (also known as the **sutta reference name**) will not be available in the exercise dataset.\n   - After obtaining the **sutta reference number**, retrieve the corresponding **sutta reference name**.\n      - Example: If **sutta reference number** is `\"AN 2.1\"`, the **sutta reference name** should be `\"vajjasutta\u1e43\"`.\n      - If the correct **sutta reference name** cannot be determined, return `\"unknown\"` instead of making an incorrect guess.\n   - Store the **sutta reference name** in the `\"class_sutta\"` field.\n\n3. **Formatting Rule for `\"class_example\"`:**\n   - The **selected Pali word** is **highlighted alone** within `<b>...</b>`.\n   - The capitalization of the entire sentence must remain exactly as in the exercise dataset.\n\n4. **`\"pali\"` Field Rule:**  \n   - The `\"pali\"` field **must always** match the **exact given Pali word**, including numbering if present (e.g., `\"anussarati 1.1\"`).\n   - Even if the extracted sentence contains a different **morphological form**, the `\"pali\"` field must **not** be altered.\n\n5. **`\"explanation\"` Field Rule:**  \n   - The `\"explanation\"` field should provide a brief justification for why the response was generated **if the user asks a question**.\n   - If the user requests a solution, provide a practical suggestion to achieve the desired outcome.\n   - If **no question is provided**, return an **empty string** (`\"\"`).\n\n6. **Output Structure and Formatting:**\n   - If a valid sentence is found and the sutta reference number is explicitly present within it, return the output in **JSON format** with the following structure:\n      {\n         \"id\": \"<Given Pali ID>\",\n         \"pali\": \"<Given Pali word>\",\n         \"selected_pali_word\": \"<Selected Pali word>\",\n         \"class_source\": \"<Sutta Reference Number>\",\n         \"class_sutta\": \"<Sutta Reference Name>\",\n         \"class_example\": \"<A full sentence with <b>Selected Pali word</b> highlighted, preserving original capitalization>\",\n         \"english_translation\": \"<English translation>\",\n         \"explanation\": \"<A justification for why this response was generated and a solution if applicable, or an empty string if no question was asked>\"\n      }\n   - If the sutta reference number is missing from the selected sentence, return an **empty JSON object** `{}`.\n   - If no valid sentence is found, return an **empty JSON object** `{}`.\n\n7. **Strict JSON Output rules:**\n   **IMPORTANT: FOLLOW THESE RULES STRICTLY**\n   - **DO NOT** wrap the JSON output in Markdown formatting (e.g., ` ```json ... ``` `).\n   - **DO NOT** add any extra text before or after the JSON response.\n   - **DO NOT** format the output as a code block.\n   - **ONLY RETURN A PLAIN JSON OBJECT.**\n   - **Failure to follow these rules will result in an invalid response.**\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "\n    For the given Pali word: \"samatikkama\" with ID: \"59264\",     extract a relevant sentence in exercise data: \"Class 2 Exercises\n\nnamo tassa bhagavato arahato samm\u0101-sambuddhassa\t \t\t\t\t\t\nHomage to him, the Blessed One, the Worthy One, the fully Enlightened One.\n\u2003\navijj\u0101ya tv'eva asesa-vir\u0101ga-nirodh\u0101 sa\u1e45kh\u0101ra-nirodho, sa\u1e45kh\u0101ra-nirodh\u0101 vi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101\u1e47a-nirodho, vi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101\u1e47a-nirodh\u0101 n\u0101mar\u016bpa-nirodho, n\u0101mar\u016bpa-nirodh\u0101 sa\u1e37\u0101yatana-nirodho, sa\u1e37\u0101yatana-nirodh\u0101 phassa-nirodho, phassa-nirodh\u0101 vedan\u0101-nirodho, vedan\u0101-nirodh\u0101 ta\u1e47h\u0101-nirodho, ta\u1e47h\u0101-nirodh\u0101 up\u0101d\u0101na-nirodho, up\u0101d\u0101na-nirodh\u0101 bhava-nirodho, bhava-nirodh\u0101 j\u0101ti-nirodho, j\u0101ti-nirodh\u0101 jar\u0101-mara\u1e47a\u1e43 soka-parideva-dukkha-domanass'up\u0101y\u0101s\u0101 nirujjhanti. \nBut from the complete fading away and cessation of ignorance there is cessation of volitional formations;

Do **not** return single-word outputs (e.g., \"<b>Anussarati</b>\").\n   - A valid **sutta reference number** (also known as the **sutta number**) must be **explicitly present within the selected sentence**.\n   - **STRICT RULE**: \n      - If the **sutta reference number** (e.g., \"AN 3.71\") is **not found directly in the selected sentence itself**, **discard the selected sentence**.\n   - Remove any **sutta reference number** from the selected sentence (e.g., \"AN 3.71\", \"AN 3.71 (simpl)\", or similar citation formats) once identified.\n   - Store the **sutta reference number** in the `\"class_source\"` field.\n   - **Handling `(simpl)` in `class_source` Formatting:**\n      - If the extracted **sutta reference number** contains **\"(simpl)\"**, preserve it (e.g., `\"DN 19.7 (simpl)\"`).\n      - If **\"(simpl)\"** is **not present**, return only the core sutta number (e.g., `\"DN 19.7\"`).\n\n2. **Ensure Correct Sutta Reference Name Retrieval:**\n   - The **sutta reference name** (also known as the **sutta reference name**) will not be available in the exercise dataset.\n   - After obtaining the **sutta reference number**, retrieve the corresponding **sutta reference name**.\n      - Example: If **sutta reference number** is `\"AN 2.1\"`, the **sutta reference name** should be `\"vajjasutta\u1e43\"`.\n      - If the correct **sutta reference name** cannot be determined, return `\"unknown\"` instead of making an incorrect guess.\n   - Store the **sutta reference name** in the `\"class_sutta\"` field.\n\n3. **Formatting Rule for `\"class_example\"`:**\n   - The **selected Pali word** is **highlighted alone** within `<b>...</b>`.\n   - The capitalization of the entire sentence must remain exactly as in the exercise dataset.\n\n4. **`\"pali\"` Field Rule:**  \n   - The `\"pali\"` field **must always** match the **exact given Pali word**, including numbering if present (e.g., `\"anussarati 1.1\"`).\n   - Even if the extracted sentence contains a different **morphological form**, the `\"pali\"` field must **not** be altered.\n\n5. **`\"explanation\"` Field Rule:**  \n   - The `\"explanation\"` field should provide a brief justification for why the response was generated **if the user asks a question**.\n   - If the user requests a solution, provide a practical suggestion to achieve the desired outcome.\n   - If **no question is provided**, return an **empty string** (`\"\"`).\n\n6. **Output Structure and Formatting:**\n   - If a valid sentence is found and the sutta reference number is explicitly present within it, return the output in **JSON format** with the following structure:\n      {\n         \"id\": \"<Given Pali ID>\",\n         \"pali\": \"<Given Pali word>\",\n         \"selected_pali_word\": \"<Selected Pali word>\",\n         \"class_source\": \"<Sutta Reference Number>\",\n         \"class_sutta\": \"<Sutta Reference Name>\",\n         \"class_example\": \"<A full sentence with <b>Selected Pali word</b> highlighted, preserving original capitalization>\",\n         \"english_translation\": \"<English translation>\",\n         \"explanation\": \"<A justification for why this response was generated and a solution if applicable, or an empty string if no question was asked>\"\n      }\n   - If the sutta reference number is missing from the selected sentence, return an **empty JSON object** `{}`.\n   - If no valid sentence is found, return an **empty JSON object** `{}`.\n\n7. **Strict JSON Output rules:**\n   **IMPORTANT: FOLLOW THESE RULES STRICTLY**\n   - **DO NOT** wrap the JSON output in Markdown formatting (e.g., ` ```json ... ``` `).\n   - **DO NOT** add any extra text before or after the JSON response.\n   - **DO NOT** format the output as a code block.\n   - **ONLY RETURN A PLAIN JSON OBJECT.**\n   - **Failure to follow these rules will result in an invalid response.**\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "\n    For the given Pali word: \"samm\u0101 1\" with ID: \"60788\",     extract a relevant sentence in exercise data: \"Class 2 Exercises\n\nnamo tassa bhagavato arahato samm\u0101-sambuddhassa\t \t\t\t\t\t\nHomage to him, the Blessed One, the Worthy One, the fully Enlightened One.\n\u2003\navijj\u0101ya tv'eva asesa-vir\u0101ga-nirodh\u0101 sa\u1e45kh\u0101ra-nirodho, sa\u1e45kh\u0101ra-nirodh\u0101 vi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101\u1e47a-nirodho, vi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101\u1e47a-nirodh\u0101 n\u0101mar\u016bpa-nirodho, n\u0101mar\u016bpa-nirodh\u0101 sa\u1e37\u0101yatana-nirodho, sa\u1e37\u0101yatana-nirodh\u0101 phassa-nirodho, phassa-nirodh\u0101 vedan\u0101-nirodho, vedan\u0101-nirodh\u0101 ta\u1e47h\u0101-nirodho, ta\u1e47h\u0101-nirodh\u0101 up\u0101d\u0101na-nirodho, up\u0101d\u0101na-nirodh\u0101 bhava-nirodho, bhava-nirodh\u0101 j\u0101ti-nirodho, j\u0101ti-nirodh\u0101 jar\u0101-mara\u1e47a\u1e43 soka-parideva-dukkha-domanass'up\u0101y\u0101s\u0101 nirujjhanti. \nBut from the complete fading away and cessation of ignorance there is cessation of volitional formations;

Do **not** return single-word outputs (e.g., \"<b>Anussarati</b>\").\n   - A valid **sutta reference number** (also known as the **sutta number**) must be **explicitly present within the selected sentence**.\n   - **STRICT RULE**: \n      - If the **sutta reference number** (e.g., \"AN 3.71\") is **not found directly in the selected sentence itself**, **discard the selected sentence**.\n   - Remove any **sutta reference number** from the selected sentence (e.g., \"AN 3.71\", \"AN 3.71 (simpl)\", or similar citation formats) once identified.\n   - Store the **sutta reference number** in the `\"class_source\"` field.\n   - **Handling `(simpl)` in `class_source` Formatting:**\n      - If the extracted **sutta reference number** contains **\"(simpl)\"**, preserve it (e.g., `\"DN 19.7 (simpl)\"`).\n      - If **\"(simpl)\"** is **not present**, return only the core sutta number (e.g., `\"DN 19.7\"`).\n\n2. **Ensure Correct Sutta Reference Name Retrieval:**\n   - The **sutta reference name** (also known as the **sutta reference name**) will not be available in the exercise dataset.\n   - After obtaining the **sutta reference number**, retrieve the corresponding **sutta reference name**.\n      - Example: If **sutta reference number** is `\"AN 2.1\"`, the **sutta reference name** should be `\"vajjasutta\u1e43\"`.\n      - If the correct **sutta reference name** cannot be determined, return `\"unknown\"` instead of making an incorrect guess.\n   - Store the **sutta reference name** in the `\"class_sutta\"` field.\n\n3. **Formatting Rule for `\"class_example\"`:**\n   - The **selected Pali word** is **highlighted alone** within `<b>...</b>`.\n   - The capitalization of the entire sentence must remain exactly as in the exercise dataset.\n\n4. **`\"pali\"` Field Rule:**  \n   - The `\"pali\"` field **must always** match the **exact given Pali word**, including numbering if present (e.g., `\"anussarati 1.1\"`).\n   - Even if the extracted sentence contains a different **morphological form**, the `\"pali\"` field must **not** be altered.\n\n5. **`\"explanation\"` Field Rule:**  \n   - The `\"explanation\"` field should provide a brief justification for why the response was generated **if the user asks a question**.\n   - If the user requests a solution, provide a practical suggestion to achieve the desired outcome.\n   - If **no question is provided**, return an **empty string** (`\"\"`).\n\n6. **Output Structure and Formatting:**\n   - If a valid sentence is found and the sutta reference number is explicitly present within it, return the output in **JSON format** with the following structure:\n      {\n         \"id\": \"<Given Pali ID>\",\n         \"pali\": \"<Given Pali word>\",\n         \"selected_pali_word\": \"<Selected Pali word>\",\n         \"class_source\": \"<Sutta Reference Number>\",\n         \"class_sutta\": \"<Sutta Reference Name>\",\n         \"class_example\": \"<A full sentence with <b>Selected Pali word</b> highlighted, preserving original capitalization>\",\n         \"english_translation\": \"<English translation>\",\n         \"explanation\": \"<A justification for why this response was generated and a solution if applicable, or an empty string if no question was asked>\"\n      }\n   - If the sutta reference number is missing from the selected sentence, return an **empty JSON object** `{}`.\n   - If no valid sentence is found, return an **empty JSON object** `{}`.\n\n7. **Strict JSON Output rules:**\n   **IMPORTANT: FOLLOW THESE RULES STRICTLY**\n   - **DO NOT** wrap the JSON output in Markdown formatting (e.g., ` ```json ... ``` `).\n   - **DO NOT** add any extra text before or after the JSON response.\n   - **DO NOT** format the output as a code block.\n   - **ONLY RETURN A PLAIN JSON OBJECT.**\n   - **Failure to follow these rules will result in an invalid response.**\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "\n    For the given Pali word: \"sa\u1e37\u0101yatana 1\" with ID: \"61506\",     extract a relevant sentence in exercise data: \"Class 2 Exercises\n\nnamo tassa bhagavato arahato samm\u0101-sambuddhassa\t \t\t\t\t\t\nHomage to him, the Blessed One, the Worthy One, the fully Enlightened One.\n\u2003\navijj\u0101ya tv'eva asesa-vir\u0101ga-nirodh\u0101 sa\u1e45kh\u0101ra-nirodho, sa\u1e45kh\u0101ra-nirodh\u0101 vi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101\u1e47a-nirodho, vi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101\u1e47a-nirodh\u0101 n\u0101mar\u016bpa-nirodho, n\u0101mar\u016bpa-nirodh\u0101 sa\u1e37\u0101yatana-nirodho, sa\u1e37\u0101yatana-nirodh\u0101 phassa-nirodho, phassa-nirodh\u0101 vedan\u0101-nirodho, vedan\u0101-nirodh\u0101 ta\u1e47h\u0101-nirodho, ta\u1e47h\u0101-nirodh\u0101 up\u0101d\u0101na-nirodho, up\u0101d\u0101na-nirodh\u0101 bhava-nirodho, bhava-nirodh\u0101 j\u0101ti-nirodho, j\u0101ti-nirodh\u0101 jar\u0101-mara\u1e47a\u1e43 soka-parideva-dukkha-domanass'up\u0101y\u0101s\u0101 nirujjhanti. \nBut from the complete fading away and cessation of ignorance there is cessation of volitional formations;

Do **not** return single-word outputs (e.g., \"<b>Anussarati</b>\").\n   - A valid **sutta reference number** (also known as the **sutta number**) must be **explicitly present within the selected sentence**.\n   - **STRICT RULE**: \n      - If the **sutta reference number** (e.g., \"AN 3.71\") is **not found directly in the selected sentence itself**, **discard the selected sentence**.\n   - Remove any **sutta reference number** from the selected sentence (e.g., \"AN 3.71\", \"AN 3.71 (simpl)\", or similar citation formats) once identified.\n   - Store the **sutta reference number** in the `\"class_source\"` field.\n   - **Handling `(simpl)` in `class_source` Formatting:**\n      - If the extracted **sutta reference number** contains **\"(simpl)\"**, preserve it (e.g., `\"DN 19.7 (simpl)\"`).\n      - If **\"(simpl)\"** is **not present**, return only the core sutta number (e.g., `\"DN 19.7\"`).\n\n2. **Ensure Correct Sutta Reference Name Retrieval:**\n   - The **sutta reference name** (also known as the **sutta reference name**) will not be available in the exercise dataset.\n   - After obtaining the **sutta reference number**, retrieve the corresponding **sutta reference name**.\n      - Example: If **sutta reference number** is `\"AN 2.1\"`, the **sutta reference name** should be `\"vajjasutta\u1e43\"`.\n      - If the correct **sutta reference name** cannot be determined, return `\"unknown\"` instead of making an incorrect guess.\n   - Store the **sutta reference name** in the `\"class_sutta\"` field.\n\n3. **Formatting Rule for `\"class_example\"`:**\n   - The **selected Pali word** is **highlighted alone** within `<b>...</b>`.\n   - The capitalization of the entire sentence must remain exactly as in the exercise dataset.\n\n4. **`\"pali\"` Field Rule:**  \n   - The `\"pali\"` field **must always** match the **exact given Pali word**, including numbering if present (e.g., `\"anussarati 1.1\"`).\n   - Even if the extracted sentence contains a different **morphological form**, the `\"pali\"` field must **not** be altered.\n\n5. **`\"explanation\"` Field Rule:**  \n   - The `\"explanation\"` field should provide a brief justification for why the response was generated **if the user asks a question**.\n   - If the user requests a solution, provide a practical suggestion to achieve the desired outcome.\n   - If **no question is provided**, return an **empty string** (`\"\"`).\n\n6. **Output Structure and Formatting:**\n   - If a valid sentence is found and the sutta reference number is explicitly present within it, return the output in **JSON format** with the following structure:\n      {\n         \"id\": \"<Given Pali ID>\",\n         \"pali\": \"<Given Pali word>\",\n         \"selected_pali_word\": \"<Selected Pali word>\",\n         \"class_source\": \"<Sutta Reference Number>\",\n         \"class_sutta\": \"<Sutta Reference Name>\",\n         \"class_example\": \"<A full sentence with <b>Selected Pali word</b> highlighted, preserving original capitalization>\",\n         \"english_translation\": \"<English translation>\",\n         \"explanation\": \"<A justification for why this response was generated and a solution if applicable, or an empty string if no question was asked>\"\n      }\n   - If the sutta reference number is missing from the selected sentence, return an **empty JSON object** `{}`.\n   - If no valid sentence is found, return an **empty JSON object** `{}`.\n\n7. **Strict JSON Output rules:**\n   **IMPORTANT: FOLLOW THESE RULES STRICTLY**\n   - **DO NOT** wrap the JSON output in Markdown formatting (e.g., ` ```json ... ``` `).\n   - **DO NOT** add any extra text before or after the JSON response.\n   - **DO NOT** format the output as a code block.\n   - **ONLY RETURN A PLAIN JSON OBJECT.**\n   - **Failure to follow these rules will result in an invalid response.**\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "\n    For the given Pali word: \"sugata 2\" with ID: \"63609\",     extract a relevant sentence in exercise data: \"Class 2 Exercises\n\nnamo tassa bhagavato arahato samm\u0101-sambuddhassa\t \t\t\t\t\t\nHomage to him, the Blessed One, the Worthy One, the fully Enlightened One.\n\u2003\navijj\u0101ya tv'eva asesa-vir\u0101ga-nirodh\u0101 sa\u1e45kh\u0101ra-nirodho, sa\u1e45kh\u0101ra-nirodh\u0101 vi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101\u1e47a-nirodho, vi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101\u1e47a-nirodh\u0101 n\u0101mar\u016bpa-nirodho, n\u0101mar\u016bpa-nirodh\u0101 sa\u1e37\u0101yatana-nirodho, sa\u1e37\u0101yatana-nirodh\u0101 phassa-nirodho, phassa-nirodh\u0101 vedan\u0101-nirodho, vedan\u0101-nirodh\u0101 ta\u1e47h\u0101-nirodho, ta\u1e47h\u0101-nirodh\u0101 up\u0101d\u0101na-nirodho, up\u0101d\u0101na-nirodh\u0101 bhava-nirodho, bhava-nirodh\u0101 j\u0101ti-nirodho, j\u0101ti-nirodh\u0101 jar\u0101-mara\u1e47a\u1e43 soka-parideva-dukkha-domanass'up\u0101y\u0101s\u0101 nirujjhanti. \nBut from the complete fading away and cessation of ignorance there is cessation of volitional formations;

Do **not** return single-word outputs (e.g., \"<b>Anussarati</b>\").\n   - A valid **sutta reference number** (also known as the **sutta number**) must be **explicitly present within the selected sentence**.\n   - **STRICT RULE**: \n      - If the **sutta reference number** (e.g., \"AN 3.71\") is **not found directly in the selected sentence itself**, **discard the selected sentence**.\n   - Remove any **sutta reference number** from the selected sentence (e.g., \"AN 3.71\", \"AN 3.71 (simpl)\", or similar citation formats) once identified.\n   - Store the **sutta reference number** in the `\"class_source\"` field.\n   - **Handling `(simpl)` in `class_source` Formatting:**\n      - If the extracted **sutta reference number** contains **\"(simpl)\"**, preserve it (e.g., `\"DN 19.7 (simpl)\"`).\n      - If **\"(simpl)\"** is **not present**, return only the core sutta number (e.g., `\"DN 19.7\"`).\n\n2. **Ensure Correct Sutta Reference Name Retrieval:**\n   - The **sutta reference name** (also known as the **sutta reference name**) will not be available in the exercise dataset.\n   - After obtaining the **sutta reference number**, retrieve the corresponding **sutta reference name**.\n      - Example: If **sutta reference number** is `\"AN 2.1\"`, the **sutta reference name** should be `\"vajjasutta\u1e43\"`.\n      - If the correct **sutta reference name** cannot be determined, return `\"unknown\"` instead of making an incorrect guess.\n   - Store the **sutta reference name** in the `\"class_sutta\"` field.\n\n3. **Formatting Rule for `\"class_example\"`:**\n   - The **selected Pali word** is **highlighted alone** within `<b>...</b>`.\n   - The capitalization of the entire sentence must remain exactly as in the exercise dataset.\n\n4. **`\"pali\"` Field Rule:**  \n   - The `\"pali\"` field **must always** match the **exact given Pali word**, including numbering if present (e.g., `\"anussarati 1.1\"`).\n   - Even if the extracted sentence contains a different **morphological form**, the `\"pali\"` field must **not** be altered.\n\n5. **`\"explanation\"` Field Rule:**  \n   - The `\"explanation\"` field should provide a brief justification for why the response was generated **if the user asks a question**.\n   - If the user requests a solution, provide a practical suggestion to achieve the desired outcome.\n   - If **no question is provided**, return an **empty string** (`\"\"`).\n\n6. **Output Structure and Formatting:**\n   - If a valid sentence is found and the sutta reference number is explicitly present within it, return the output in **JSON format** with the following structure:\n      {\n         \"id\": \"<Given Pali ID>\",\n         \"pali\": \"<Given Pali word>\",\n         \"selected_pali_word\": \"<Selected Pali word>\",\n         \"class_source\": \"<Sutta Reference Number>\",\n         \"class_sutta\": \"<Sutta Reference Name>\",\n         \"class_example\": \"<A full sentence with <b>Selected Pali word</b> highlighted, preserving original capitalization>\",\n         \"english_translation\": \"<English translation>\",\n         \"explanation\": \"<A justification for why this response was generated and a solution if applicable, or an empty string if no question was asked>\"\n      }\n   - If the sutta reference number is missing from the selected sentence, return an **empty JSON object** `{}`.\n   - If no valid sentence is found, return an **empty JSON object** `{}`.\n\n7. **Strict JSON Output rules:**\n   **IMPORTANT: FOLLOW THESE RULES STRICTLY**\n   - **DO NOT** wrap the JSON output in Markdown formatting (e.g., ` ```json ... ``` `).\n   - **DO NOT** add any extra text before or after the JSON response.\n   - **DO NOT** format the output as a code block.\n   - **ONLY RETURN A PLAIN JSON OBJECT.**\n   - **Failure to follow these rules will result in an invalid response.**\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "\n    For the given Pali word: \"sokaparideva\" with ID: \"65095\",     extract a relevant sentence in exercise data: \"Class 2 Exercises\n\nnamo tassa bhagavato arahato samm\u0101-sambuddhassa\t \t\t\t\t\t\nHomage to him, the Blessed One, the Worthy One, the fully Enlightened One.\n\u2003\navijj\u0101ya tv'eva asesa-vir\u0101ga-nirodh\u0101 sa\u1e45kh\u0101ra-nirodho, sa\u1e45kh\u0101ra-nirodh\u0101 vi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101\u1e47a-nirodho, vi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101\u1e47a-nirodh\u0101 n\u0101mar\u016bpa-nirodho, n\u0101mar\u016bpa-nirodh\u0101 sa\u1e37\u0101yatana-nirodho, sa\u1e37\u0101yatana-nirodh\u0101 phassa-nirodho, phassa-nirodh\u0101 vedan\u0101-nirodho, vedan\u0101-nirodh\u0101 ta\u1e47h\u0101-nirodho, ta\u1e47h\u0101-nirodh\u0101 up\u0101d\u0101na-nirodho, up\u0101d\u0101na-nirodh\u0101 bhava-nirodho, bhava-nirodh\u0101 j\u0101ti-nirodho, j\u0101ti-nirodh\u0101 jar\u0101-mara\u1e47a\u1e43 soka-parideva-dukkha-domanass'up\u0101y\u0101s\u0101 nirujjhanti. \nBut from the complete fading away and cessation of ignorance there is cessation of volitional formations;

Do **not** return single-word outputs (e.g., \"<b>Anussarati</b>\").\n   - A valid **sutta reference number** (also known as the **sutta number**) must be **explicitly present within the selected sentence**.\n   - **STRICT RULE**: \n      - If the **sutta reference number** (e.g., \"AN 3.71\") is **not found directly in the selected sentence itself**, **discard the selected sentence**.\n   - Remove any **sutta reference number** from the selected sentence (e.g., \"AN 3.71\", \"AN 3.71 (simpl)\", or similar citation formats) once identified.\n   - Store the **sutta reference number** in the `\"class_source\"` field.\n   - **Handling `(simpl)` in `class_source` Formatting:**\n      - If the extracted **sutta reference number** contains **\"(simpl)\"**, preserve it (e.g., `\"DN 19.7 (simpl)\"`).\n      - If **\"(simpl)\"** is **not present**, return only the core sutta number (e.g., `\"DN 19.7\"`).\n\n2. **Ensure Correct Sutta Reference Name Retrieval:**\n   - The **sutta reference name** (also known as the **sutta reference name**) will not be available in the exercise dataset.\n   - After obtaining the **sutta reference number**, retrieve the corresponding **sutta reference name**.\n      - Example: If **sutta reference number** is `\"AN 2.1\"`, the **sutta reference name** should be `\"vajjasutta\u1e43\"`.\n      - If the correct **sutta reference name** cannot be determined, return `\"unknown\"` instead of making an incorrect guess.\n   - Store the **sutta reference name** in the `\"class_sutta\"` field.\n\n3. **Formatting Rule for `\"class_example\"`:**\n   - The **selected Pali word** is **highlighted alone** within `<b>...</b>`.\n   - The capitalization of the entire sentence must remain exactly as in the exercise dataset.\n\n4. **`\"pali\"` Field Rule:**  \n   - The `\"pali\"` field **must always** match the **exact given Pali word**, including numbering if present (e.g., `\"anussarati 1.1\"`).\n   - Even if the extracted sentence contains a different **morphological form**, the `\"pali\"` field must **not** be altered.\n\n5. **`\"explanation\"` Field Rule:**  \n   - The `\"explanation\"` field should provide a brief justification for why the response was generated **if the user asks a question**.\n   - If the user requests a solution, provide a practical suggestion to achieve the desired outcome.\n   - If **no question is provided**, return an **empty string** (`\"\"`).\n\n6. **Output Structure and Formatting:**\n   - If a valid sentence is found and the sutta reference number is explicitly present within it, return the output in **JSON format** with the following structure:\n      {\n         \"id\": \"<Given Pali ID>\",\n         \"pali\": \"<Given Pali word>\",\n         \"selected_pali_word\": \"<Selected Pali word>\",\n         \"class_source\": \"<Sutta Reference Number>\",\n         \"class_sutta\": \"<Sutta Reference Name>\",\n         \"class_example\": \"<A full sentence with <b>Selected Pali word</b> highlighted, preserving original capitalization>\",\n         \"english_translation\": \"<English translation>\",\n         \"explanation\": \"<A justification for why this response was generated and a solution if applicable, or an empty string if no question was asked>\"\n      }\n   - If the sutta reference number is missing from the selected sentence, return an **empty JSON object** `{}`.\n   - If no valid sentence is found, return an **empty JSON object** `{}`.\n\n7. **Strict JSON Output rules:**\n   **IMPORTANT: FOLLOW THESE RULES STRICTLY**\n   - **DO NOT** wrap the JSON output in Markdown formatting (e.g., ` ```json ... ``` `).\n   - **DO NOT** add any extra text before or after the JSON response.\n   - **DO NOT** format the output as a code block.\n   - **ONLY RETURN A PLAIN JSON OBJECT.**\n   - **Failure to follow these rules will result in an invalid response.**\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "\n    For the given Pali word: \"vinaya 1\" with ID: \"68086\",     extract a relevant sentence in exercise data: \"Class 2 Exercises\n\nnamo tassa bhagavato arahato samm\u0101-sambuddhassa\t \t\t\t\t\t\nHomage to him, the Blessed One, the Worthy One, the fully Enlightened One.\n\u2003\navijj\u0101ya tv'eva asesa-vir\u0101ga-nirodh\u0101 sa\u1e45kh\u0101ra-nirodho, sa\u1e45kh\u0101ra-nirodh\u0101 vi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101\u1e47a-nirodho, vi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101\u1e47a-nirodh\u0101 n\u0101mar\u016bpa-nirodho, n\u0101mar\u016bpa-nirodh\u0101 sa\u1e37\u0101yatana-nirodho, sa\u1e37\u0101yatana-nirodh\u0101 phassa-nirodho, phassa-nirodh\u0101 vedan\u0101-nirodho, vedan\u0101-nirodh\u0101 ta\u1e47h\u0101-nirodho, ta\u1e47h\u0101-nirodh\u0101 up\u0101d\u0101na-nirodho, up\u0101d\u0101na-nirodh\u0101 bhava-nirodho, bhava-nirodh\u0101 j\u0101ti-nirodho, j\u0101ti-nirodh\u0101 jar\u0101-mara\u1e47a\u1e43 soka-parideva-dukkha-domanass'up\u0101y\u0101s\u0101 nirujjhanti. \nBut from the complete fading away and cessation of ignorance there is cessation of volitional formations;

Do **not** return single-word outputs (e.g., \"<b>Anussarati</b>\").\n   - A valid **sutta reference number** (also known as the **sutta number**) must be **explicitly present within the selected sentence**.\n   - **STRICT RULE**: \n      - If the **sutta reference number** (e.g., \"AN 3.71\") is **not found directly in the selected sentence itself**, **discard the selected sentence**.\n   - Remove any **sutta reference number** from the selected sentence (e.g., \"AN 3.71\", \"AN 3.71 (simpl)\", or similar citation formats) once identified.\n   - Store the **sutta reference number** in the `\"class_source\"` field.\n   - **Handling `(simpl)` in `class_source` Formatting:**\n      - If the extracted **sutta reference number** contains **\"(simpl)\"**, preserve it (e.g., `\"DN 19.7 (simpl)\"`).\n      - If **\"(simpl)\"** is **not present**, return only the core sutta number (e.g., `\"DN 19.7\"`).\n\n2. **Ensure Correct Sutta Reference Name Retrieval:**\n   - The **sutta reference name** (also known as the **sutta reference name**) will not be available in the exercise dataset.\n   - After obtaining the **sutta reference number**, retrieve the corresponding **sutta reference name**.\n      - Example: If **sutta reference number** is `\"AN 2.1\"`, the **sutta reference name** should be `\"vajjasutta\u1e43\"`.\n      - If the correct **sutta reference name** cannot be determined, return `\"unknown\"` instead of making an incorrect guess.\n   - Store the **sutta reference name** in the `\"class_sutta\"` field.\n\n3. **Formatting Rule for `\"class_example\"`:**\n   - The **selected Pali word** is **highlighted alone** within `<b>...</b>`.\n   - The capitalization of the entire sentence must remain exactly as in the exercise dataset.\n\n4. **`\"pali\"` Field Rule:**  \n   - The `\"pali\"` field **must always** match the **exact given Pali word**, including numbering if present (e.g., `\"anussarati 1.1\"`).\n   - Even if the extracted sentence contains a different **morphological form**, the `\"pali\"` field must **not** be altered.\n\n5. **`\"explanation\"` Field Rule:**  \n   - The `\"explanation\"` field should provide a brief justification for why the response was generated **if the user asks a question**.\n   - If the user requests a solution, provide a practical suggestion to achieve the desired outcome.\n   - If **no question is provided**, return an **empty string** (`\"\"`).\n\n6. **Output Structure and Formatting:**\n   - If a valid sentence is found and the sutta reference number is explicitly present within it, return the output in **JSON format** with the following structure:\n      {\n         \"id\": \"<Given Pali ID>\",\n         \"pali\": \"<Given Pali word>\",\n         \"selected_pali_word\": \"<Selected Pali word>\",\n         \"class_source\": \"<Sutta Reference Number>\",\n         \"class_sutta\": \"<Sutta Reference Name>\",\n         \"class_example\": \"<A full sentence with <b>Selected Pali word</b> highlighted, preserving original capitalization>\",\n         \"english_translation\": \"<English translation>\",\n         \"explanation\": \"<A justification for why this response was generated and a solution if applicable, or an empty string if no question was asked>\"\n      }\n   - If the sutta reference number is missing from the selected sentence, return an **empty JSON object** `{}`.\n   - If no valid sentence is found, return an **empty JSON object** `{}`.\n\n7. **Strict JSON Output rules:**\n   **IMPORTANT: FOLLOW THESE RULES STRICTLY**\n   - **DO NOT** wrap the JSON output in Markdown formatting (e.g., ` ```json ... ``` `).\n   - **DO NOT** add any extra text before or after the JSON response.\n   - **DO NOT** format the output as a code block.\n   - **ONLY RETURN A PLAIN JSON OBJECT.**\n   - **Failure to follow these rules will result in an invalid response.**\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "\n    For the given Pali word: \"vir\u0101ga 2.1\" with ID: \"68872\",     extract a relevant sentence in exercise data: \"Class 2 Exercises\n\nnamo tassa bhagavato arahato samm\u0101-sambuddhassa\t \t\t\t\t\t\nHomage to him, the Blessed One, the Worthy One, the fully Enlightened One.\n\u2003\navijj\u0101ya tv'eva asesa-vir\u0101ga-nirodh\u0101 sa\u1e45kh\u0101ra-nirodho, sa\u1e45kh\u0101ra-nirodh\u0101 vi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101\u1e47a-nirodho, vi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101\u1e47a-nirodh\u0101 n\u0101mar\u016bpa-nirodho, n\u0101mar\u016bpa-nirodh\u0101 sa\u1e37\u0101yatana-nirodho, sa\u1e37\u0101yatana-nirodh\u0101 phassa-nirodho, phassa-nirodh\u0101 vedan\u0101-nirodho, vedan\u0101-nirodh\u0101 ta\u1e47h\u0101-nirodho, ta\u1e47h\u0101-nirodh\u0101 up\u0101d\u0101na-nirodho, up\u0101d\u0101na-nirodh\u0101 bhava-nirodho, bhava-nirodh\u0101 j\u0101ti-nirodho, j\u0101ti-nirodh\u0101 jar\u0101-mara\u1e47a\u1e43 soka-parideva-dukkha-domanass'up\u0101y\u0101s\u0101 nirujjhanti. \nBut from the complete fading away and cessation of ignorance there is cessation of volitional formations;

Do **not** return single-word outputs (e.g., \"<b>Anussarati</b>\").\n   - A valid **sutta reference number** (also known as the **sutta number**) must be **explicitly present within the selected sentence**.\n   - **STRICT RULE**: \n      - If the **sutta reference number** (e.g., \"AN 3.71\") is **not found directly in the selected sentence itself**, **discard the selected sentence**.\n   - Remove any **sutta reference number** from the selected sentence (e.g., \"AN 3.71\", \"AN 3.71 (simpl)\", or similar citation formats) once identified.\n   - Store the **sutta reference number** in the `\"class_source\"` field.\n   - **Handling `(simpl)` in `class_source` Formatting:**\n      - If the extracted **sutta reference number** contains **\"(simpl)\"**, preserve it (e.g., `\"DN 19.7 (simpl)\"`).\n      - If **\"(simpl)\"** is **not present**, return only the core sutta number (e.g., `\"DN 19.7\"`).\n\n2. **Ensure Correct Sutta Reference Name Retrieval:**\n   - The **sutta reference name** (also known as the **sutta reference name**) will not be available in the exercise dataset.\n   - After obtaining the **sutta reference number**, retrieve the corresponding **sutta reference name**.\n      - Example: If **sutta reference number** is `\"AN 2.1\"`, the **sutta reference name** should be `\"vajjasutta\u1e43\"`.\n      - If the correct **sutta reference name** cannot be determined, return `\"unknown\"` instead of making an incorrect guess.\n   - Store the **sutta reference name** in the `\"class_sutta\"` field.\n\n3. **Formatting Rule for `\"class_example\"`:**\n   - The **selected Pali word** is **highlighted alone** within `<b>...</b>`.\n   - The capitalization of the entire sentence must remain exactly as in the exercise dataset.\n\n4. **`\"pali\"` Field Rule:**  \n   - The `\"pali\"` field **must always** match the **exact given Pali word**, including numbering if present (e.g., `\"anussarati 1.1\"`).\n   - Even if the extracted sentence contains a different **morphological form**, the `\"pali\"` field must **not** be altered.\n\n5. **`\"explanation\"` Field Rule:**  \n   - The `\"explanation\"` field should provide a brief justification for why the response was generated **if the user asks a question**.\n   - If the user requests a solution, provide a practical suggestion to achieve the desired outcome.\n   - If **no question is provided**, return an **empty string** (`\"\"`).\n\n6. **Output Structure and Formatting:**\n   - If a valid sentence is found and the sutta reference number is explicitly present within it, return the output in **JSON format** with the following structure:\n      {\n         \"id\": \"<Given Pali ID>\",\n         \"pali\": \"<Given Pali word>\",\n         \"selected_pali_word\": \"<Selected Pali word>\",\n         \"class_source\": \"<Sutta Reference Number>\",\n         \"class_sutta\": \"<Sutta Reference Name>\",\n         \"class_example\": \"<A full sentence with <b>Selected Pali word</b> highlighted, preserving original capitalization>\",\n         \"english_translation\": \"<English translation>\",\n         \"explanation\": \"<A justification for why this response was generated and a solution if applicable, or an empty string if no question was asked>\"\n      }\n   - If the sutta reference number is missing from the selected sentence, return an **empty JSON object** `{}`.\n   - If no valid sentence is found, return an **empty JSON object** `{}`.\n\n7. **Strict JSON Output rules:**\n   **IMPORTANT: FOLLOW THESE RULES STRICTLY**\n   - **DO NOT** wrap the JSON output in Markdown formatting (e.g., ` ```json ... ``` `).\n   - **DO NOT** add any extra text before or after the JSON response.\n   - **DO NOT** format the output as a code block.\n   - **ONLY RETURN A PLAIN JSON OBJECT.**\n   - **Failure to follow these rules will result in an invalid response.**\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "\n    For the given Pali word: \"vedan\u0101 1\" with ID: \"70238\",     extract a relevant sentence in exercise data: \"Class 2 Exercises\n\nnamo tassa bhagavato arahato samm\u0101-sambuddhassa\t \t\t\t\t\t\nHomage to him, the Blessed One, the Worthy One, the fully Enlightened One.\n\u2003\navijj\u0101ya tv'eva asesa-vir\u0101ga-nirodh\u0101 sa\u1e45kh\u0101ra-nirodho, sa\u1e45kh\u0101ra-nirodh\u0101 vi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101\u1e47a-nirodho, vi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101\u1e47a-nirodh\u0101 n\u0101mar\u016bpa-nirodho, n\u0101mar\u016bpa-nirodh\u0101 sa\u1e37\u0101yatana-nirodho, sa\u1e37\u0101yatana-nirodh\u0101 phassa-nirodho, phassa-nirodh\u0101 vedan\u0101-nirodho, vedan\u0101-nirodh\u0101 ta\u1e47h\u0101-nirodho, ta\u1e47h\u0101-nirodh\u0101 up\u0101d\u0101na-nirodho, up\u0101d\u0101na-nirodh\u0101 bhava-nirodho, bhava-nirodh\u0101 j\u0101ti-nirodho, j\u0101ti-nirodh\u0101 jar\u0101-mara\u1e47a\u1e43 soka-parideva-dukkha-domanass'up\u0101y\u0101s\u0101 nirujjhanti. \nBut from the complete fading away and cessation of ignorance there is cessation of volitional formations;

Your primary task is to extract **full sentences** from an exercise dataset based on a given Pali word. Follow these instructions carefully:\n\n1. **Extract and Structure Data:**\n   - Identify sentences in the exercise dataset that contain the **given Pali word**, recognizing its various forms (e.g., declensions and conjugations).\n   - Extract **full sentences** that provide meaningful context. Do **not** return single-word outputs (e.g., \"<b>Anussarati</b>\").\n   - A valid **sutta reference number** (also known as the **sutta number**) must be **explicitly present within the selected sentence**.\n   - **STRICT RULE**: \n      - If the **sutta reference number** (e.g., \"AN 3.71\") is **not found directly in the selected sentence itself**, **discard the selected sentence**.\n   - Remove any **sutta reference number** from the selected sentence (e.g., \"AN 3.71\", \"AN 3.71 (simpl)\", or similar citation formats) once identified.\n   - Store the **sutta reference number** in the `\"class_source\"` field.\n   - **Handling `(simpl)` in `class_source` Formatting:**\n      - If the extracted **sutta reference number** contains **\"(simpl)\"**, preserve it (e.g., `\"DN 19.7 (simpl)\"`).\n      - If **\"(simpl)\"** is **not present**, return only the core sutta number (e.g., `\"DN 19.7\"`).\n\n2. **Ensure Correct Sutta Reference Name Retrieval:**\n   - The **sutta reference name** (also known as the **sutta reference name**) will not be available in the exercise dataset.\n   - After obtaining the **sutta reference number**, retrieve the corresponding **sutta reference name**.\n      - Example: If **sutta reference number** is `\"AN 2.1\"`, the **sutta reference name** should be `\"vajjasutta\u1e43\"`.\n      - If the correct **sutta reference name** cannot be determined, return `\"unknown\"` instead of making an incorrect guess.\n   - Store the **sutta reference name** in the `\"class_sutta\"` field.\n\n3. **Formatting Rule for `\"class_example\"`:**\n   - The **selected Pali word** is **highlighted alone** within `<b>...</b>`.\n   - The capitalization of the entire sentence must remain exactly as in the exercise dataset.\n\n4. **`\"pali\"` Field Rule:**  \n   - The `\"pali\"` field **must always** match the **exact given Pali word**, including numbering if present (e.g., `\"anussarati 1.1\"`).\n   - Even if the extracted sentence contains a different **morphological form**, the `\"pali\"` field must **not** be altered.\n\n5. **`\"explanation\"` Field Rule:**  \n   - The `\"explanation\"` field should provide a brief justification for why the response was generated **if the user asks a question**.\n   - If the user requests a solution, provide a practical suggestion to achieve the desired outcome.\n   - If **no question is provided**, return an **empty string** (`\"\"`).\n\n6. **Output Structure and Formatting:**\n   - If a valid sentence is found and the sutta reference number is explicitly present within it, return the output in **JSON format** with the following structure:\n      {\n         \"id\": \"<Given Pali ID>\",\n         \"pali\": \"<Given Pali word>\",\n         \"selected_pali_word\": \"<Selected Pali word>\",\n         \"class_source\": \"<Sutta Reference Number>\",\n         \"class_sutta\": \"<Sutta Reference Name>\",\n         \"class_example\": \"<A full sentence with <b>Selected Pali word</b> highlighted, preserving original capitalization>\",\n         \"english_translation\": \"<English translation>\",\n         \"explanation\": \"<A justification for why this response was generated and a solution if applicable, or an empty string if no question was asked>\"\n      }\n   - If the sutta reference number is missing from the selected sentence, return an **empty JSON object** `{}`.\n   - If no valid sentence is found, return an **empty JSON object** `{}`.\n\n7. **Strict JSON Output rules:**\n   **IMPORTANT: FOLLOW THESE RULES STRICTLY**\n   - **DO NOT** wrap the JSON output in Markdown formatting (e.g., ` ```json ... ``` `).\n   - **DO NOT** add any extra text before or after the JSON response.\n   - **DO NOT** format the output as a code block.\n   - **ONLY RETURN A PLAIN JSON OBJECT.**\n   - **Failure to follow these rules will result in an invalid response.**\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "\n    For the given Pali word: \"\u0101b\u0101dha 2\" with ID: \"76068\",     extract a relevant sentence in exercise data: \"Class 2 Exercises\n\nnamo tassa bhagavato arahato samm\u0101-sambuddhassa\t \t\t\t\t\t\nHomage to him, the Blessed One, the Worthy One, the fully Enlightened One.\n\u2003\navijj\u0101ya tv'eva asesa-vir\u0101ga-nirodh\u0101 sa\u1e45kh\u0101ra-nirodho, sa\u1e45kh\u0101ra-nirodh\u0101 vi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101\u1e47a-nirodho, vi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101\u1e47a-nirodh\u0101 n\u0101mar\u016bpa-nirodho, n\u0101mar\u016bpa-nirodh\u0101 sa\u1e37\u0101yatana-nirodho, sa\u1e37\u0101yatana-nirodh\u0101 phassa-nirodho, phassa-nirodh\u0101 vedan\u0101-nirodho, vedan\u0101-nirodh\u0101 ta\u1e47h\u0101-nirodho, ta\u1e47h\u0101-nirodh\u0101 up\u0101d\u0101na-nirodho, up\u0101d\u0101na-nirodh\u0101 bhava-nirodho, bhava-nirodh\u0101 j\u0101ti-nirodho, j\u0101ti-nirodh\u0101 jar\u0101-mara\u1e47a\u1e43 soka-parideva-dukkha-domanass'up\u0101y\u0101s\u0101 nirujjhanti. \nBut from the complete fading away and cessation of ignorance there is cessation of volitional formations;
