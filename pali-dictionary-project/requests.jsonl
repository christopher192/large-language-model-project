Your primary task is to extract **full sentences** from an exercise dataset based on a given Pali word. Follow these instructions carefully:\n\n1. **Extract and Structure Data:**\n   - Identify sentences in the exercise dataset that contain the **given Pali word**, recognizing its various forms (e.g., declensions and conjugations).\n   - Extract **full sentences** that provide meaningful context. Do **not** return single-word outputs (e.g., \"<b>Anussarati</b>\").\n   - A valid **sutta reference number** (also known as the **sutta number**) must be **explicitly present within the selected sentence**.\n   - **STRICT RULE**: \n      - If the **sutta reference number** (e.g., \"AN 3.71\") is **not found directly in the selected sentence itself**, **discard the selected sentence**.\n   - Remove any **sutta reference number** from the selected sentence (e.g., \"AN 3.71\", \"AN 3.71 (simpl)\", or similar citation formats) once identified.\n   - Store the **sutta reference number** in the `\"class_source\"` field.\n   - **Handling `(simpl)` in `class_source` Formatting:**\n      - If the extracted **sutta reference number** contains **\"(simpl)\"**, preserve it (e.g., `\"DN 19.7 (simpl)\"`).\n      - If **\"(simpl)\"** is **not present**, return only the core sutta number (e.g., `\"DN 19.7\"`).\n\n2. **Ensure Correct Sutta Reference Name Retrieval:**\n   - The **sutta reference name** (also known as the **sutta reference name**) will not be available in the exercise dataset.\n   - After obtaining the **sutta reference number**, retrieve the corresponding **sutta reference name**.\n      - Example: If **sutta reference number** is `\"AN 2.1\"`, the **sutta reference name** should be `\"vajjasutta\u1e43\"`.\n      - If the correct **sutta reference name** cannot be determined, return `\"unknown\"` instead of making an incorrect guess.\n   - Store the **sutta reference name** in the `\"class_sutta\"` field.\n\n3. **Formatting Rule for `\"class_example\"`:**\n   - The **selected Pali word** is **highlighted alone** within `<b>...</b>`.\n   - The capitalization of the entire sentence must remain exactly as in the exercise dataset.\n\n4. **`\"pali\"` Field Rule:**  \n   - The `\"pali\"` field **must always** match the **exact given Pali word**, including numbering if present (e.g., `\"anussarati 1.1\"`).\n   - Even if the extracted sentence contains a different **morphological form**, the `\"pali\"` field must **not** be altered.\n\n5. **`\"explanation\"` Field Rule:**  \n   - The `\"explanation\"` field should provide a brief justification for why the response was generated **if the user asks a question**.\n   - If the user requests a solution, provide a practical suggestion to achieve the desired outcome.\n   - If **no question is provided**, return an **empty string** (`\"\"`).\n\n6. **Output Structure and Formatting:**\n   - If a valid sentence is found and the sutta reference number is explicitly present within it, return the output in **JSON format** with the following structure:\n      {\n         \"id\": \"<Given Pali ID>\",\n         \"pali\": \"<Given Pali word>\",\n

Your primary task is to extract **full sentences** from an exercise dataset based on a given Pali word. Follow these instructions carefully:\n\n1. **Extract and Structure Data:**\n   - Identify sentences in the exercise dataset that contain the **given Pali word**, recognizing its various forms (e.g., declensions and conjugations).\n   - Extract **full sentences** that provide meaningful context. Do **not** return single-word outputs (e.g., \"<b>Anussarati</b>\").\n   - A valid **sutta reference number** (also known as the **sutta number**) must be **explicitly present within the selected sentence**.\n   - **STRICT RULE**: \n      - If the **sutta reference number** (e.g., \"AN 3.71\") is **not found directly in the selected sentence itself**, **discard the selected sentence**.\n   - Remove any **sutta reference number** from the selected sentence (e.g., \"AN 3.71\", \"AN 3.71 (simpl)\", or similar citation formats) once identified.\n   - Store the **sutta reference number** in the `\"class_source\"` field.\n   - **Handling `(simpl)` in `class_source` Formatting:**\n      - If the extracted **sutta reference number** contains **\"(simpl)\"**, preserve it (e.g., `\"DN 19.7 (simpl)\"`).\n      - If **\"(simpl)\"** is **not present**, return only the core sutta number (e.g., `\"DN 19.7\"`).\n\n2. **Ensure Correct Sutta Reference Name Retrieval:**\n   - The **sutta reference name** (also known as the **sutta reference name**) will not be available in the exercise dataset.\n   - After obtaining the **sutta reference number**, retrieve the corresponding **sutta reference name**.\n      - Example: If **sutta reference number** is `\"AN 2.1\"`, the **sutta reference name** should be `\"vajjasutta\u1e43\"`.\n      - If the correct **sutta reference name** cannot be determined, return `\"unknown\"` instead of making an incorrect guess.\n   - Store the **sutta reference name** in the `\"class_sutta\"` field.\n\n3. **Formatting Rule for `\"class_example\"`:**\n   - The **selected Pali word** is **highlighted alone** within `<b>...</b>`.\n   - The capitalization of the entire sentence must remain exactly as in the exercise dataset.\n\n4. **`\"pali\"` Field Rule:**  \n   - The `\"pali\"` field **must always** match the **exact given Pali word**, including numbering if present (e.g., `\"anussarati 1.1\"`).\n   - Even if the extracted sentence contains a different **morphological form**, the `\"pali\"` field must **not** be altered.\n\n5. **`\"explanation\"` Field Rule:**  \n   - The `\"explanation\"` field should provide a brief justification for why the response was generated **if the user asks a question**.\n   - If the user requests a solution, provide a practical suggestion to achieve the desired outcome.\n   - If **no question is provided**, return an **empty string** (`\"\"`).\n\n6. **Output Structure and Formatting:**\n   - If a valid sentence is found and the sutta reference number is explicitly present within it, return the output in **JSON format** with the following structure:\n      {\n         \"id\": \"<Given Pali ID>\",\n         \"pali\": \"<Given Pali word>\",\n

Your primary task is to extract **full sentences** from an exercise dataset based on a given Pali word. Follow these instructions carefully:\n\n1. **Extract and Structure Data:**\n   - Identify sentences in the exercise dataset that contain the **given Pali word**, recognizing its various forms (e.g., declensions and conjugations).\n   - Extract **full sentences** that provide meaningful context. Do **not** return single-word outputs (e.g., \"<b>Anussarati</b>\").\n   - A valid **sutta reference number** (also known as the **sutta number**) must be **explicitly present within the selected sentence**.\n   - **STRICT RULE**: \n      - If the **sutta reference number** (e.g., \"AN 3.71\") is **not found directly in the selected sentence itself**, **discard the selected sentence**.\n   - Remove any **sutta reference number** from the selected sentence (e.g., \"AN 3.71\", \"AN 3.71 (simpl)\", or similar citation formats) once identified.\n   - Store the **sutta reference number** in the `\"class_source\"` field.\n   - **Handling `(simpl)` in `class_source` Formatting:**\n      - If the extracted **sutta reference number** contains **\"(simpl)\"**, preserve it (e.g., `\"DN 19.7 (simpl)\"`).\n      - If **\"(simpl)\"** is **not present**, return only the core sutta number (e.g., `\"DN 19.7\"`).\n\n2. **Ensure Correct Sutta Reference Name Retrieval:**\n   - The **sutta reference name** (also known as the **sutta reference name**) will not be available in the exercise dataset.\n   - After obtaining the **sutta reference number**, retrieve the corresponding **sutta reference name**.\n      - Example: If **sutta reference number** is `\"AN 2.1\"`, the **sutta reference name** should be `\"vajjasutta\u1e43\"`.\n      - If the correct **sutta reference name** cannot be determined, return `\"unknown\"` instead of making an incorrect guess.\n   - Store the **sutta reference name** in the `\"class_sutta\"` field.\n\n3. **Formatting Rule for `\"class_example\"`:**\n   - The **selected Pali word** is **highlighted alone** within `<b>...</b>`.\n   - The capitalization of the entire sentence must remain exactly as in the exercise dataset.\n\n4. **`\"pali\"` Field Rule:**  \n   - The `\"pali\"` field **must always** match the **exact given Pali word**, including numbering if present (e.g., `\"anussarati 1.1\"`).\n   - Even if the extracted sentence contains a different **morphological form**, the `\"pali\"` field must **not** be altered.\n\n5. **`\"explanation\"` Field Rule:**  \n   - The `\"explanation\"` field should provide a brief justification for why the response was generated **if the user asks a question**.\n   - If the user requests a solution, provide a practical suggestion to achieve the desired outcome.\n   - If **no question is provided**, return an **empty string** (`\"\"`).\n\n6. **Output Structure and Formatting:**\n   - If a valid sentence is found and the sutta reference number is explicitly present within it, return the output in **JSON format** with the following structure:\n      {\n         \"id\": \"<Given Pali ID>\",\n         \"pali\": \"<Given Pali word>\",\n

Your primary task is to extract **full sentences** from an exercise dataset based on a given Pali word. Follow these instructions carefully:\n\n1. **Extract and Structure Data:**\n   - Identify sentences in the exercise dataset that contain the **given Pali word**, recognizing its various forms (e.g., declensions and conjugations).\n   - Extract **full sentences** that provide meaningful context. Do **not** return single-word outputs (e.g., \"<b>Anussarati</b>\").\n   - A valid **sutta reference number** (also known as the **sutta number**) must be **explicitly present within the selected sentence**.\n   - **STRICT RULE**: \n      - If the **sutta reference number** (e.g., \"AN 3.71\") is **not found directly in the selected sentence itself**, **discard the selected sentence**.\n   - Remove any **sutta reference number** from the selected sentence (e.g., \"AN 3.71\", \"AN 3.71 (simpl)\", or similar citation formats) once identified.\n   - Store the **sutta reference number** in the `\"class_source\"` field.\n   - **Handling `(simpl)` in `class_source` Formatting:**\n      - If the extracted **sutta reference number** contains **\"(simpl)\"**, preserve it (e.g., `\"DN 19.7 (simpl)\"`).\n      - If **\"(simpl)\"** is **not present**, return only the core sutta number (e.g., `\"DN 19.7\"`).\n\n2. **Ensure Correct Sutta Reference Name Retrieval:**\n   - The **sutta reference name** (also known as the **sutta reference name**) will not be available in the exercise dataset.\n   - After obtaining the **sutta reference number**, retrieve the corresponding **sutta reference name**.\n      - Example: If **sutta reference number** is `\"AN 2.1\"`, the **sutta reference name** should be `\"vajjasutta\u1e43\"`.\n      - If the correct **sutta reference name** cannot be determined, return `\"unknown\"` instead of making an incorrect guess.\n   - Store the **sutta reference name** in the `\"class_sutta\"` field.\n\n3. **Formatting Rule for `\"class_example\"`:**\n   - The **selected Pali word** is **highlighted alone** within `<b>...</b>`.\n   - The capitalization of the entire sentence must remain exactly as in the exercise dataset.\n\n4. **`\"pali\"` Field Rule:**  \n   - The `\"pali\"` field **must always** match the **exact given Pali word**, including numbering if present (e.g., `\"anussarati 1.1\"`).\n   - Even if the extracted sentence contains a different **morphological form**, the `\"pali\"` field must **not** be altered.\n\n5. **`\"explanation\"` Field Rule:**  \n   - The `\"explanation\"` field should provide a brief justification for why the response was generated **if the user asks a question**.\n   - If the user requests a solution, provide a practical suggestion to achieve the desired outcome.\n   - If **no question is provided**, return an **empty string** (`\"\"`).\n\n6. **Output Structure and Formatting:**\n   - If a valid sentence is found and the sutta reference number is explicitly present within it, return the output in **JSON format** with the following structure:\n      {\n         \"id\": \"<Given Pali ID>\",\n         \"pali\": \"<Given Pali word>\",\n

Your primary task is to extract **full sentences** from an exercise dataset based on a given Pali word. Follow these instructions carefully:\n\n1. **Extract and Structure Data:**\n   - Identify sentences in the exercise dataset that contain the **given Pali word**, recognizing its various forms (e.g., declensions and conjugations).\n   - Extract **full sentences** that provide meaningful context. Do **not** return single-word outputs (e.g., \"<b>Anussarati</b>\").\n   - A valid **sutta reference number** (also known as the **sutta number**) must be **explicitly present within the selected sentence**.\n   - **STRICT RULE**: \n      - If the **sutta reference number** (e.g., \"AN 3.71\") is **not found directly in the selected sentence itself**, **discard the selected sentence**.\n   - Remove any **sutta reference number** from the selected sentence (e.g., \"AN 3.71\", \"AN 3.71 (simpl)\", or similar citation formats) once identified.\n   - Store the **sutta reference number** in the `\"class_source\"` field.\n   - **Handling `(simpl)` in `class_source` Formatting:**\n      - If the extracted **sutta reference number** contains **\"(simpl)\"**, preserve it (e.g., `\"DN 19.7 (simpl)\"`).\n      - If **\"(simpl)\"** is **not present**, return only the core sutta number (e.g., `\"DN 19.7\"`).\n\n2. **Ensure Correct Sutta Reference Name Retrieval:**\n   - The **sutta reference name** (also known as the **sutta reference name**) will not be available in the exercise dataset.\n   - After obtaining the **sutta reference number**, retrieve the corresponding **sutta reference name**.\n      - Example: If **sutta reference number** is `\"AN 2.1\"`, the **sutta reference name** should be `\"vajjasutta\u1e43\"`.\n      - If the correct **sutta reference name** cannot be determined, return `\"unknown\"` instead of making an incorrect guess.\n   - Store the **sutta reference name** in the `\"class_sutta\"` field.\n\n3. **Formatting Rule for `\"class_example\"`:**\n   - The **selected Pali word** is **highlighted alone** within `<b>...</b>`.\n   - The capitalization of the entire sentence must remain exactly as in the exercise dataset.\n\n4. **`\"pali\"` Field Rule:**  \n   - The `\"pali\"` field **must always** match the **exact given Pali word**, including numbering if present (e.g., `\"anussarati 1.1\"`).\n   - Even if the extracted sentence contains a different **morphological form**, the `\"pali\"` field must **not** be altered.\n\n5. **`\"explanation\"` Field Rule:**  \n   - The `\"explanation\"` field should provide a brief justification for why the response was generated **if the user asks a question**.\n   - If the user requests a solution, provide a practical suggestion to achieve the desired outcome.\n   - If **no question is provided**, return an **empty string** (`\"\"`).\n\n6. **Output Structure and Formatting:**\n   - If a valid sentence is found and the sutta reference number is explicitly present within it, return the output in **JSON format** with the following structure:\n      {\n         \"id\": \"<Given Pali ID>\",\n         \"pali\": \"<Given Pali word>\",\n

Your primary task is to extract **full sentences** from an exercise dataset based on a given Pali word. Follow these instructions carefully:\n\n1. **Extract and Structure Data:**\n   - Identify sentences in the exercise dataset that contain the **given Pali word**, recognizing its various forms (e.g., declensions and conjugations).\n   - Extract **full sentences** that provide meaningful context. Do **not** return single-word outputs (e.g., \"<b>Anussarati</b>\").\n   - A valid **sutta reference number** (also known as the **sutta number**) must be **explicitly present within the selected sentence**.\n   - **STRICT RULE**: \n      - If the **sutta reference number** (e.g., \"AN 3.71\") is **not found directly in the selected sentence itself**, **discard the selected sentence**.\n   - Remove any **sutta reference number** from the selected sentence (e.g., \"AN 3.71\", \"AN 3.71 (simpl)\", or similar citation formats) once identified.\n   - Store the **sutta reference number** in the `\"class_source\"` field.\n   - **Handling `(simpl)` in `class_source` Formatting:**\n      - If the extracted **sutta reference number** contains **\"(simpl)\"**, preserve it (e.g., `\"DN 19.7 (simpl)\"`).\n      - If **\"(simpl)\"** is **not present**, return only the core sutta number (e.g., `\"DN 19.7\"`).\n\n2. **Ensure Correct Sutta Reference Name Retrieval:**\n   - The **sutta reference name** (also known as the **sutta reference name**) will not be available in the exercise dataset.\n   - After obtaining the **sutta reference number**, retrieve the corresponding **sutta reference name**.\n      - Example: If **sutta reference number** is `\"AN 2.1\"`, the **sutta reference name** should be `\"vajjasutta\u1e43\"`.\n      - If the correct **sutta reference name** cannot be determined, return `\"unknown\"` instead of making an incorrect guess.\n   - Store the **sutta reference name** in the `\"class_sutta\"` field.\n\n3. **Formatting Rule for `\"class_example\"`:**\n   - The **selected Pali word** is **highlighted alone** within `<b>...</b>`.\n   - The capitalization of the entire sentence must remain exactly as in the exercise dataset.\n\n4. **`\"pali\"` Field Rule:**  \n   - The `\"pali\"` field **must always** match the **exact given Pali word**, including numbering if present (e.g., `\"anussarati 1.1\"`).\n   - Even if the extracted sentence contains a different **morphological form**, the `\"pali\"` field must **not** be altered.\n\n5. **`\"explanation\"` Field Rule:**  \n   - The `\"explanation\"` field should provide a brief justification for why the response was generated **if the user asks a question**.\n   - If the user requests a solution, provide a practical suggestion to achieve the desired outcome.\n   - If **no question is provided**, return an **empty string** (`\"\"`).\n\n6. **Output Structure and Formatting:**\n   - If a valid sentence is found and the sutta reference number is explicitly present within it, return the output in **JSON format** with the following structure:\n      {\n         \"id\": \"<Given Pali ID>\",\n         \"pali\": \"<Given Pali word>\",\n

Your primary task is to extract **full sentences** from an exercise dataset based on a given Pali word. Follow these instructions carefully:\n\n1. **Extract and Structure Data:**\n   - Identify sentences in the exercise dataset that contain the **given Pali word**, recognizing its various forms (e.g., declensions and conjugations).\n   - Extract **full sentences** that provide meaningful context. Do **not** return single-word outputs (e.g., \"<b>Anussarati</b>\").\n   - A valid **sutta reference number** (also known as the **sutta number**) must be **explicitly present within the selected sentence**.\n   - **STRICT RULE**: \n      - If the **sutta reference number** (e.g., \"AN 3.71\") is **not found directly in the selected sentence itself**, **discard the selected sentence**.\n   - Remove any **sutta reference number** from the selected sentence (e.g., \"AN 3.71\", \"AN 3.71 (simpl)\", or similar citation formats) once identified.\n   - Store the **sutta reference number** in the `\"class_source\"` field.\n   - **Handling `(simpl)` in `class_source` Formatting:**\n      - If the extracted **sutta reference number** contains **\"(simpl)\"**, preserve it (e.g., `\"DN 19.7 (simpl)\"`).\n      - If **\"(simpl)\"** is **not present**, return only the core sutta number (e.g., `\"DN 19.7\"`).\n\n2. **Ensure Correct Sutta Reference Name Retrieval:**\n   - The **sutta reference name** (also known as the **sutta reference name**) will not be available in the exercise dataset.\n   - After obtaining the **sutta reference number**, retrieve the corresponding **sutta reference name**.\n      - Example: If **sutta reference number** is `\"AN 2.1\"`, the **sutta reference name** should be `\"vajjasutta\u1e43\"`.\n      - If the correct **sutta reference name** cannot be determined, return `\"unknown\"` instead of making an incorrect guess.\n   - Store the **sutta reference name** in the `\"class_sutta\"` field.\n\n3. **Formatting Rule for `\"class_example\"`:**\n   - The **selected Pali word** is **highlighted alone** within `<b>...</b>`.\n   - The capitalization of the entire sentence must remain exactly as in the exercise dataset.\n\n4. **`\"pali\"` Field Rule:**  \n   - The `\"pali\"` field **must always** match the **exact given Pali word**, including numbering if present (e.g., `\"anussarati 1.1\"`).\n   - Even if the extracted sentence contains a different **morphological form**, the `\"pali\"` field must **not** be altered.\n\n5. **`\"explanation\"` Field Rule:**  \n   - The `\"explanation\"` field should provide a brief justification for why the response was generated **if the user asks a question**.\n   - If the user requests a solution, provide a practical suggestion to achieve the desired outcome.\n   - If **no question is provided**, return an **empty string** (`\"\"`).\n\n6. **Output Structure and Formatting:**\n   - If a valid sentence is found and the sutta reference number is explicitly present within it, return the output in **JSON format** with the following structure:\n      {\n         \"id\": \"<Given Pali ID>\",\n         \"pali\": \"<Given Pali word>\",\n

Your primary task is to extract **full sentences** from an exercise dataset based on a given Pali word. Follow these instructions carefully:\n\n1. **Extract and Structure Data:**\n   - Identify sentences in the exercise dataset that contain the **given Pali word**, recognizing its various forms (e.g., declensions and conjugations).\n   - Extract **full sentences** that provide meaningful context. Do **not** return single-word outputs (e.g., \"<b>Anussarati</b>\").\n   - A valid **sutta reference number** (also known as the **sutta number**) must be **explicitly present within the selected sentence**.\n   - **STRICT RULE**: \n      - If the **sutta reference number** (e.g., \"AN 3.71\") is **not found directly in the selected sentence itself**, **discard the selected sentence**.\n   - Remove any **sutta reference number** from the selected sentence (e.g., \"AN 3.71\", \"AN 3.71 (simpl)\", or similar citation formats) once identified.\n   - Store the **sutta reference number** in the `\"class_source\"` field.\n   - **Handling `(simpl)` in `class_source` Formatting:**\n      - If the extracted **sutta reference number** contains **\"(simpl)\"**, preserve it (e.g., `\"DN 19.7 (simpl)\"`).\n      - If **\"(simpl)\"** is **not present**, return only the core sutta number (e.g., `\"DN 19.7\"`).\n\n2. **Ensure Correct Sutta Reference Name Retrieval:**\n   - The **sutta reference name** (also known as the **sutta reference name**) will not be available in the exercise dataset.\n   - After obtaining the **sutta reference number**, retrieve the corresponding **sutta reference name**.\n      - Example: If **sutta reference number** is `\"AN 2.1\"`, the **sutta reference name** should be `\"vajjasutta\u1e43\"`.\n      - If the correct **sutta reference name** cannot be determined, return `\"unknown\"` instead of making an incorrect guess.\n   - Store the **sutta reference name** in the `\"class_sutta\"` field.\n\n3. **Formatting Rule for `\"class_example\"`:**\n   - The **selected Pali word** is **highlighted alone** within `<b>...</b>`.\n   - The capitalization of the entire sentence must remain exactly as in the exercise dataset.\n\n4. **`\"pali\"` Field Rule:**  \n   - The `\"pali\"` field **must always** match the **exact given Pali word**, including numbering if present (e.g., `\"anussarati 1.1\"`).\n   - Even if the extracted sentence contains a different **morphological form**, the `\"pali\"` field must **not** be altered.\n\n5. **`\"explanation\"` Field Rule:**  \n   - The `\"explanation\"` field should provide a brief justification for why the response was generated **if the user asks a question**.\n   - If the user requests a solution, provide a practical suggestion to achieve the desired outcome.\n   - If **no question is provided**, return an **empty string** (`\"\"`).\n\n6. **Output Structure and Formatting:**\n   - If a valid sentence is found and the sutta reference number is explicitly present within it, return the output in **JSON format** with the following structure:\n      {\n         \"id\": \"<Given Pali ID>\",\n         \"pali\": \"<Given Pali word>\",\n

Your primary task is to extract **full sentences** from an exercise dataset based on a given Pali word. Follow these instructions carefully:\n\n1. **Extract and Structure Data:**\n   - Identify sentences in the exercise dataset that contain the **given Pali word**, recognizing its various forms (e.g., declensions and conjugations).\n   - Extract **full sentences** that provide meaningful context. Do **not** return single-word outputs (e.g., \"<b>Anussarati</b>\").\n   - A valid **sutta reference number** (also known as the **sutta number**) must be **explicitly present within the selected sentence**.\n   - **STRICT RULE**: \n      - If the **sutta reference number** (e.g., \"AN 3.71\") is **not found directly in the selected sentence itself**, **discard the selected sentence**.\n   - Remove any **sutta reference number** from the selected sentence (e.g., \"AN 3.71\", \"AN 3.71 (simpl)\", or similar citation formats) once identified.\n   - Store the **sutta reference number** in the `\"class_source\"` field.\n   - **Handling `(simpl)` in `class_source` Formatting:**\n      - If the extracted **sutta reference number** contains **\"(simpl)\"**, preserve it (e.g., `\"DN 19.7 (simpl)\"`).\n      - If **\"(simpl)\"** is **not present**, return only the core sutta number (e.g., `\"DN 19.7\"`).\n\n2. **Ensure Correct Sutta Reference Name Retrieval:**\n   - The **sutta reference name** (also known as the **sutta reference name**) will not be available in the exercise dataset.\n   - After obtaining the **sutta reference number**, retrieve the corresponding **sutta reference name**.\n      - Example: If **sutta reference number** is `\"AN 2.1\"`, the **sutta reference name** should be `\"vajjasutta\u1e43\"`.\n      - If the correct **sutta reference name** cannot be determined, return `\"unknown\"` instead of making an incorrect guess.\n   - Store the **sutta reference name** in the `\"class_sutta\"` field.\n\n3. **Formatting Rule for `\"class_example\"`:**\n   - The **selected Pali word** is **highlighted alone** within `<b>...</b>`.\n   - The capitalization of the entire sentence must remain exactly as in the exercise dataset.\n\n4. **`\"pali\"` Field Rule:**  \n   - The `\"pali\"` field **must always** match the **exact given Pali word**, including numbering if present (e.g., `\"anussarati 1.1\"`).\n   - Even if the extracted sentence contains a different **morphological form**, the `\"pali\"` field must **not** be altered.\n\n5. **`\"explanation\"` Field Rule:**  \n   - The `\"explanation\"` field should provide a brief justification for why the response was generated **if the user asks a question**.\n   - If the user requests a solution, provide a practical suggestion to achieve the desired outcome.\n   - If **no question is provided**, return an **empty string** (`\"\"`).\n\n6. **Output Structure and Formatting:**\n   - If a valid sentence is found and the sutta reference number is explicitly present within it, return the output in **JSON format** with the following structure:\n      {\n         \"id\": \"<Given Pali ID>\",\n         \"pali\": \"<Given Pali word>\",\n

Your primary task is to extract **full sentences** from an exercise dataset based on a given Pali word. Follow these instructions carefully:\n\n1. **Extract and Structure Data:**\n   - Identify sentences in the exercise dataset that contain the **given Pali word**, recognizing its various forms (e.g., declensions and conjugations).\n   - Extract **full sentences** that provide meaningful context. Do **not** return single-word outputs (e.g., \"<b>Anussarati</b>\").\n   - A valid **sutta reference number** (also known as the **sutta number**) must be **explicitly present within the selected sentence**.\n   - **STRICT RULE**: \n      - If the **sutta reference number** (e.g., \"AN 3.71\") is **not found directly in the selected sentence itself**, **discard the selected sentence**.\n   - Remove any **sutta reference number** from the selected sentence (e.g., \"AN 3.71\", \"AN 3.71 (simpl)\", or similar citation formats) once identified.\n   - Store the **sutta reference number** in the `\"class_source\"` field.\n   - **Handling `(simpl)` in `class_source` Formatting:**\n      - If the extracted **sutta reference number** contains **\"(simpl)\"**, preserve it (e.g., `\"DN 19.7 (simpl)\"`).\n      - If **\"(simpl)\"** is **not present**, return only the core sutta number (e.g., `\"DN 19.7\"`).\n\n2. **Ensure Correct Sutta Reference Name Retrieval:**\n   - The **sutta reference name** (also known as the **sutta reference name**) will not be available in the exercise dataset.\n   - After obtaining the **sutta reference number**, retrieve the corresponding **sutta reference name**.\n      - Example: If **sutta reference number** is `\"AN 2.1\"`, the **sutta reference name** should be `\"vajjasutta\u1e43\"`.\n      - If the correct **sutta reference name** cannot be determined, return `\"unknown\"` instead of making an incorrect guess.\n   - Store the **sutta reference name** in the `\"class_sutta\"` field.\n\n3. **Formatting Rule for `\"class_example\"`:**\n   - The **selected Pali word** is **highlighted alone** within `<b>...</b>`.\n   - The capitalization of the entire sentence must remain exactly as in the exercise dataset.\n\n4. **`\"pali\"` Field Rule:**  \n   - The `\"pali\"` field **must always** match the **exact given Pali word**, including numbering if present (e.g., `\"anussarati 1.1\"`).\n   - Even if the extracted sentence contains a different **morphological form**, the `\"pali\"` field must **not** be altered.\n\n5. **`\"explanation\"` Field Rule:**  \n   - The `\"explanation\"` field should provide a brief justification for why the response was generated **if the user asks a question**.\n   - If the user requests a solution, provide a practical suggestion to achieve the desired outcome.\n   - If **no question is provided**, return an **empty string** (`\"\"`).\n\n6. **Output Structure and Formatting:**\n   - If a valid sentence is found and the sutta reference number is explicitly present within it, return the output in **JSON format** with the following structure:\n      {\n         \"id\": \"<Given Pali ID>\",\n         \"pali\": \"<Given Pali word>\",\n

Your primary task is to extract **full sentences** from an exercise dataset based on a given Pali word. Follow these instructions carefully:\n\n1. **Extract and Structure Data:**\n   - Identify sentences in the exercise dataset that contain the **given Pali word**, recognizing its various forms (e.g., declensions and conjugations).\n   - Extract **full sentences** that provide meaningful context. Do **not** return single-word outputs (e.g., \"<b>Anussarati</b>\").\n   - A valid **sutta reference number** (also known as the **sutta number**) must be **explicitly present within the selected sentence**.\n   - **STRICT RULE**: \n      - If the **sutta reference number** (e.g., \"AN 3.71\") is **not found directly in the selected sentence itself**, **discard the selected sentence**.\n   - Remove any **sutta reference number** from the selected sentence (e.g., \"AN 3.71\", \"AN 3.71 (simpl)\", or similar citation formats) once identified.\n   - Store the **sutta reference number** in the `\"class_source\"` field.\n   - **Handling `(simpl)` in `class_source` Formatting:**\n      - If the extracted **sutta reference number** contains **\"(simpl)\"**, preserve it (e.g., `\"DN 19.7 (simpl)\"`).\n      - If **\"(simpl)\"** is **not present**, return only the core sutta number (e.g., `\"DN 19.7\"`).\n\n2. **Ensure Correct Sutta Reference Name Retrieval:**\n   - The **sutta reference name** (also known as the **sutta reference name**) will not be available in the exercise dataset.\n   - After obtaining the **sutta reference number**, retrieve the corresponding **sutta reference name**.\n      - Example: If **sutta reference number** is `\"AN 2.1\"`, the **sutta reference name** should be `\"vajjasutta\u1e43\"`.\n      - If the correct **sutta reference name** cannot be determined, return `\"unknown\"` instead of making an incorrect guess.\n   - Store the **sutta reference name** in the `\"class_sutta\"` field.\n\n3. **Formatting Rule for `\"class_example\"`:**\n   - The **selected Pali word** is **highlighted alone** within `<b>...</b>`.\n   - The capitalization of the entire sentence must remain exactly as in the exercise dataset.\n\n4. **`\"pali\"` Field Rule:**  \n   - The `\"pali\"` field **must always** match the **exact given Pali word**, including numbering if present (e.g., `\"anussarati 1.1\"`).\n   - Even if the extracted sentence contains a different **morphological form**, the `\"pali\"` field must **not** be altered.\n\n5. **`\"explanation\"` Field Rule:**  \n   - The `\"explanation\"` field should provide a brief justification for why the response was generated **if the user asks a question**.\n   - If the user requests a solution, provide a practical suggestion to achieve the desired outcome.\n   - If **no question is provided**, return an **empty string** (`\"\"`).\n\n6. **Output Structure and Formatting:**\n   - If a valid sentence is found and the sutta reference number is explicitly present within it, return the output in **JSON format** with the following structure:\n      {\n         \"id\": \"<Given Pali ID>\",\n         \"pali\": \"<Given Pali word>\",\n

Your primary task is to extract **full sentences** from an exercise dataset based on a given Pali word. Follow these instructions carefully:\n\n1. **Extract and Structure Data:**\n   - Identify sentences in the exercise dataset that contain the **given Pali word**, recognizing its various forms (e.g., declensions and conjugations).\n   - Extract **full sentences** that provide meaningful context. Do **not** return single-word outputs (e.g., \"<b>Anussarati</b>\").\n   - A valid **sutta reference number** (also known as the **sutta number**) must be **explicitly present within the selected sentence**.\n   - **STRICT RULE**: \n      - If the **sutta reference number** (e.g., \"AN 3.71\") is **not found directly in the selected sentence itself**, **discard the selected sentence**.\n   - Remove any **sutta reference number** from the selected sentence (e.g., \"AN 3.71\", \"AN 3.71 (simpl)\", or similar citation formats) once identified.\n   - Store the **sutta reference number** in the `\"class_source\"` field.\n   - **Handling `(simpl)` in `class_source` Formatting:**\n      - If the extracted **sutta reference number** contains **\"(simpl)\"**, preserve it (e.g., `\"DN 19.7 (simpl)\"`).\n      - If **\"(simpl)\"** is **not present**, return only the core sutta number (e.g., `\"DN 19.7\"`).\n\n2. **Ensure Correct Sutta Reference Name Retrieval:**\n   - The **sutta reference name** (also known as the **sutta reference name**) will not be available in the exercise dataset.\n   - After obtaining the **sutta reference number**, retrieve the corresponding **sutta reference name**.\n      - Example: If **sutta reference number** is `\"AN 2.1\"`, the **sutta reference name** should be `\"vajjasutta\u1e43\"`.\n      - If the correct **sutta reference name** cannot be determined, return `\"unknown\"` instead of making an incorrect guess.\n   - Store the **sutta reference name** in the `\"class_sutta\"` field.\n\n3. **Formatting Rule for `\"class_example\"`:**\n   - The **selected Pali word** is **highlighted alone** within `<b>...</b>`.\n   - The capitalization of the entire sentence must remain exactly as in the exercise dataset.\n\n4. **`\"pali\"` Field Rule:**  \n   - The `\"pali\"` field **must always** match the **exact given Pali word**, including numbering if present (e.g., `\"anussarati 1.1\"`).\n   - Even if the extracted sentence contains a different **morphological form**, the `\"pali\"` field must **not** be altered.\n\n5. **`\"explanation\"` Field Rule:**  \n   - The `\"explanation\"` field should provide a brief justification for why the response was generated **if the user asks a question**.\n   - If the user requests a solution, provide a practical suggestion to achieve the desired outcome.\n   - If **no question is provided**, return an **empty string** (`\"\"`).\n\n6. **Output Structure and Formatting:**\n   - If a valid sentence is found and the sutta reference number is explicitly present within it, return the output in **JSON format** with the following structure:\n      {\n         \"id\": \"<Given Pali ID>\",\n         \"pali\": \"<Given Pali word>\",\n

Your primary task is to extract **full sentences** from an exercise dataset based on a given Pali word. Follow these instructions carefully:\n\n1. **Extract and Structure Data:**\n   - Identify sentences in the exercise dataset that contain the **given Pali word**, recognizing its various forms (e.g., declensions and conjugations).\n   - Extract **full sentences** that provide meaningful context. Do **not** return single-word outputs (e.g., \"<b>Anussarati</b>\").\n   - A valid **sutta reference number** (also known as the **sutta number**) must be **explicitly present within the selected sentence**.\n   - **STRICT RULE**: \n      - If the **sutta reference number** (e.g., \"AN 3.71\") is **not found directly in the selected sentence itself**, **discard the selected sentence**.\n   - Remove any **sutta reference number** from the selected sentence (e.g., \"AN 3.71\", \"AN 3.71 (simpl)\", or similar citation formats) once identified.\n   - Store the **sutta reference number** in the `\"class_source\"` field.\n   - **Handling `(simpl)` in `class_source` Formatting:**\n      - If the extracted **sutta reference number** contains **\"(simpl)\"**, preserve it (e.g., `\"DN 19.7 (simpl)\"`).\n      - If **\"(simpl)\"** is **not present**, return only the core sutta number (e.g., `\"DN 19.7\"`).\n\n2. **Ensure Correct Sutta Reference Name Retrieval:**\n   - The **sutta reference name** (also known as the **sutta reference name**) will not be available in the exercise dataset.\n   - After obtaining the **sutta reference number**, retrieve the corresponding **sutta reference name**.\n      - Example: If **sutta reference number** is `\"AN 2.1\"`, the **sutta reference name** should be `\"vajjasutta\u1e43\"`.\n      - If the correct **sutta reference name** cannot be determined, return `\"unknown\"` instead of making an incorrect guess.\n   - Store the **sutta reference name** in the `\"class_sutta\"` field.\n\n3. **Formatting Rule for `\"class_example\"`:**\n   - The **selected Pali word** is **highlighted alone** within `<b>...</b>`.\n   - The capitalization of the entire sentence must remain exactly as in the exercise dataset.\n\n4. **`\"pali\"` Field Rule:**  \n   - The `\"pali\"` field **must always** match the **exact given Pali word**, including numbering if present (e.g., `\"anussarati 1.1\"`).\n   - Even if the extracted sentence contains a different **morphological form**, the `\"pali\"` field must **not** be altered.\n\n5. **`\"explanation\"` Field Rule:**  \n   - The `\"explanation\"` field should provide a brief justification for why the response was generated **if the user asks a question**.\n   - If the user requests a solution, provide a practical suggestion to achieve the desired outcome.\n   - If **no question is provided**, return an **empty string** (`\"\"`).\n\n6. **Output Structure and Formatting:**\n   - If a valid sentence is found and the sutta reference number is explicitly present within it, return the output in **JSON format** with the following structure:\n      {\n         \"id\": \"<Given Pali ID>\",\n         \"pali\": \"<Given Pali word>\",\n
